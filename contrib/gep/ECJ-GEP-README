Before you do anything else, please read the file "ECJ-GEP-LICENSE",
located in this directory. It contains the software license
you are bound to if you wish to use this software -- note that
the license is not *quite* your normal open source license;
it requires you to make certain admissions about using ECJ-GEP in
your published research work. It is the same license used for ECJ.

Additionally, please see the following important files:

docs/gep-extension.html         ECJ-GEP documentation.  
ECJ-GEP-LICENSE			            The ECJ-GEP license.

All of the source code for the GEP extension to ECJ is found under ec/gep.

The documentation file mentioned above is found in the 'docs' directory.

The required javacsv.jar file is found in the 'start' directory.
The required meditor.jar file is found in the 'start' directory.

Also there have been very minor changes to 3 standard ecj files:

	ec/EvolutionState.java    
	ec/Evolve.java
	ec/display/Console.java   (optional replacement)
	
These files should replace the standard ecj files before compiling the ecj-gep system.

This version works with ECJ 18.
