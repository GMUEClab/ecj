# This parameter file provides basic GEP-specific stuff.
# 
# Some rules about Java Property Lists, which is what the
# system uses for parameters.  Java property lists are a little weird:
# 
# 1. Lines with only whitespace are ignored.
# 2. Lines beginning with a # are ignored.
# 3. Initial whitespace is trimmed.  The property is everything up to 
#    the next chunk of whitespace or a '='
# 4. A following '=' is *optional*
# 5. After the chunk of whitespace and the optional '=', the next
#    whitespace is trimmed.
# 6. Typically, EVERYTHING after that is the value of the property, 
#    up to but not including a '\n'. However, my version trims off
#    the final bit of whitespace if any.
# 7. If two parameters of the same name are found, the later one
#    is used.
#
# Some examples and warnings:
#
# LINE (begins at | )          PROPERTY(between /'s)  VALUE(between /'s)
#
# |yo.yo.yo! = heave ho               /yo.yo.yo!/            /heave ho/

# The linking function may be one of +, -, * or / for most problems

# Problem type must be one of: functionfinding, classification, timeseries, logical
# Set default to be 'unknown' so user is forced to specify in the problem params file 
gep.species.problemtype = unknown

# If the problem is a classification type problem a threshold value (used
# to convert real values to 0 or 1 during fitness calculations) must be 
# specified (do not specify this unless it IS a classification type problem).
# gep.species.classification-threshold  = 0.5

# If the problem type is timeseries then the user can provide the raw time series data 
# (in a file or from the user program) or the processed data in the same format as
# other problem types ... see below. If using raw data then the user must specify: 
#   timeseries-delay -- if 1 uses each time series value, if 2 uses every other one, etc.
#   timeseries-embeddingdimension -- determines the number of timeseries points to use 
#        as independent variables when transforming the set of time series data. Another
#        data point is used as the dependent variable value. So the time series 'raw' data
#        consisting of a list of single values is processed by splitting the data into
#        groups (rows) of size embeddingdimension+1. From the end of the time series data
#        embeddingdimension+1 values are chosen (if delay is 1 all values are chosen, if 
#        2 every other one is chosen). The last value is the independent variable value.
#        Then the next row is selected by moving 'delay'
#        values from the end and chosing embeddingdimension+1 values. This is repeated
#        until no more sets of size embeddingdimension+1 can be chosen. If this produces
#        n sets of data then testingprediction of them are used for testing and
#        (n - testingpredictions) are used for training.
#
#        So if we had the data:
#        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
#        and delay was 1 and embeddingdimension was 4 then we'd process the set into 
#        the following 17 data sets. If testingpredictions was 6 then the 1st 11
#        would be used for training and the LAST 6 for testing
#        iv1 iv2 iv3 iv4  dv
#          1   2   3   4   5
#          2   3   4   5   6
#          3   4   5   6   7
#              . . .
#         14  15  16  17  18
#         15  16  17  18  19
#         16  17  18  19  20
#         17  18  19  20  21
#        If delay was 2 then 7 sets would be formed as:
#        iv1 iv2 iv3 iv4  dv
#          1   3   5   7   9
#          3   5   7   9  11
#              . . .
#          9  11  13  15  17
#         11  13  15  17  19
#         13  15  17  19  21
#   timeseries-testingpredictions -- specifies the number of sets of data to devote to testing
#
# gep.species.timeseries-delay    1
# gep.species.timeseries-embeddingdimension 4
# gep.species.timeseries-testingpredictions 6           

# Specifying the symbols to be used (functions and terminals)

# gep.species.symbolset.terminal.0 = x
#
# OR for the terminal set the info can be in a text file where the file
# has the names of the terminal symbols and the dependent variable
# in the first record/line (comma separated, space separated, tab separated, etc).
# If the filename ends with .dat then a space is the delimeter, otherwise it
# is assumed to be a comma delimiter. However, the separator can be
# specified directly by including a terminalfileseparator parameter.
# The training values for the terminal symbols are in in the other 
# records; the number of terminals is computed from the number of terminal
# symbols in the 1st record. So a file might look like:
# x1, x2, x3, dvar
# 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 1.8
# 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.6
# ...
# 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 6.0
#
# Can use "," or "comma" to specify a comma separator
# Can use "\\t" or "tab" to specify a tab separator
# Use "space" to specifiy a space as the separator
# The field separator defaults to 'comma' unless the filename ends in .dat in
# which case it defaults to a space. The separator can be
# changed by including a terminalfileseparator parameter.
#
# gep.species.symbolset.terminalfilename = filename
# gep.species.symbolset.terminalfileseparator = ,
# or for a tab
# gep.species.symbolset.terminalfileseparator = tab
# or for a space
# gep.species.symbolset.terminalfileseparator = space
#
# NOTE for a time series problem do NOT specify the terminals. They will
# be detemined automatically as the time series data is processed. Also
# for time series problems a data file will have only a list of data values
# in the file. The first row will NOT have terminal symbol names. The
# data values in a file can have 1 or more values per row (separated by commas
# or tabs as specified).
#
# Can also have a text file with the TESTING data values...it will use the same separator
# as the file with the training data and terminal symbol (variable) names. In this
# case there is NO line with the terminal symbol names! Also for a timeseries data file the 
# test data and the training data are in the same file (specified by terminalfilename). 
# The gep.species.timeseries-testingpredictions indicates how many rows of the data 
# set to use for testing (after the timeseries file has been processed as described
# above); the remaining rows are used for training.  
#
# NOTE: the text files can be gzip'd files (.gz of .gzip extensions) and there is no 
# need to uncompress them. So you might have the file abc.txt.gz and we will treat it as if it were
# the file abc.txt.

# ec.SimpleStatistics
# ==============================

# output statistics to the file "out.stat" in the directory
# the run was started in
# GEPSimpleStatistics has a number of parameters it
# can use to control the output:
#   file - The main output is directed to the file specified by the file param
#   file-observed-versus-computed - this file, if specified, gets the results
#         of the best of run model by listing the observed values versus
#         the model's predicted values (useful for plotting). By default this
#         will include the training and testing data values (with test values
#         appended to the end if they exist). To get the training and testing
#         values separated identify a second file in the paramater 
#         file-observed-versus-computed-test. If not specified prints to the 
#         main output file if specified or to the console.
#   file-observed-versus-computed-test - If specificed, this identifies a
#         a file with only the test data. If not specified prints to console.
#   no-observed-versus-computed - if true then don't print any observed/computed values
#         even if files are specified
#  
#   detail-to-log - the user can specify the detail of the output to the main
#         log file (param 'file')
#             all - it can display the best model from every generation (can be a large
#                   amount of output)
#             change - logs the best model of the generation when the fitness improves (default)
