Before you do anything else, please read the file "CGP-ECJ-LICENSE",
located in this directory. It contains the software license
you are bound to if you wish to use this software -- note that
the license is not *quite* your normal open source license;
it requires you to make certain admissions about using CGP-ECJ in
your published research work. It is the same license used for ECJ.

Additionally, please see the following important files:

docs/index.html         CGP-ECJ documentation.  
CGP-ECJ-LICENSE			The CGP-ECJ license.

All of the source code for the CGP extension to ECJ is found under ec/cgp.

The documentation file mentioned above is found in the 'docs' directory.

Data used in the sample classification problems is located in the 'data' 
directory.

To compile CGP for ECJ, you will need Java 1.5 due to the internal use of 
generics.

Feel free to contact me with any questions, comments, complaints, 
suggestions, success stories, etc.  I am very interested in expanding
this distribution of CGP for ECJ to include many more sample problem 
domains.
