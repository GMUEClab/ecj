This directory contains example applications for the DRM.

The DRM programming tutorial uses these applications as
examples to illustrate basic concepts.

To recompile the examples, you have to add the drm package
to you classpath, which normally means adding the file
drm.jar.

For example, if the DRM istallation directory is
/home/garfield/DRM-2.0 then you can compile example 1
by saying

example/1$ javac -classpath /home/garfield/DRM-2.0/lib/drm.jar Launch.java hwjob/HelloWorld.java

You can generate a jar file suitable for exectution in the DRM:

example/1$ jar cf ../1.jar Launch.class hwjob/HelloWorld.class
