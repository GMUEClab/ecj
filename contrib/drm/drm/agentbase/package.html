The agent layer defines a very basic core functionality for handling mobile
agents.
This layer is simpler, contains less possibilities than many sophisticated
agents systems.
This is because the special requirements and goals of the architecture.

<P>
The layer defines the concept of a <em>base</em> and the
<EM>agent</EM> as the two building blocks of an agent system.
The idea is that the base is a container or playground of agents.
Agents live in bases.
The base provides services that the agents can use when moving to another
base or when they need information about the environment or when the
want to communicate with other agents or bases.
The base provides services not only to its agents but to its environment
too.
Agents can be added, the list of agents can be asked for, etc.

<P>
Two more basic concepts are defined: the
<EM>address</EM> and the <EM>message</EM>.
These are quite self-explaining.
Every base and agent has an address and messages can be sent between
bases and agents, agents and agents and bases and bases.
