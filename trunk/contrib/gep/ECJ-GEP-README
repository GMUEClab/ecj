Before you do anything else, please read the file "ECJ-GEP-LICENSE",
located in this directory. It contains the software license
you are bound to if you wish to use this software -- note that
the license is not *quite* your normal open source license;
it requires you to make certain admissions about using ECJ-GEP in
your published research work. It is the same license used for ECJ.

Additionally, please see the following important files:

docs/gep-extension.html         ECJ-GEP documentation.  
ECJ-GEP-LICENSE			            The ECJ-GEP license.

All of the source code for the GEP extension to ECJ is found under ec/gep.

The documentation file mentioned above is found in the 'docs' directory.

The required javacsv.jar file is found in the 'start' directory.

Also there have been very minor changes to 3 standard ecj files:

	ec/EvolutionState.java    
	ec/Evolve.java
	ec/display/Console.java   (optional replacement)
	
These files should replace the standard ecj files before compiling the ecj-gep system.

This version works with ECJ 16.
