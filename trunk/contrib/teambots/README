KNOWN TO COMPILE WITH ECJ VERSION 16.

This directory contains code to help you hook ECJ together with
teambots, for evolved robot experiments.  The general idea is that
we treat Teambots as a subsidiary library of ECJ.
The files in this directory are as follows:

0. EvolvedControlSystem.java
   An empty subclass of Teambots' 
   EDU.gatech.cc.is.abstractrobot.ControlSystemS class.  You should
   make your control systems a subclass of EvolvedControlSystem if
   you can: we may add hooks into this at a future date.  See
   TeambotsExampleProblem for an example.

1. ECSimulationCanvas.java
   This is a special class that ECJ uses instead of Teambots'
   standard TBSim.ECSimulationCanvas class.  The main difference
   is that it allows ECJ to brain-wipe and reset Teambots inbetween
   evaluations.

2. TeambotsProblem.java
   A special abstract subclass of Problem with hooks for communicating
   with ECSimulationCanvas.  All your Problems that do Teambots
   evaluation will subclass from TeambotsProblem.

3. TeambotsExampleProblem.java
   A template example showing how to make a TeambotsProblem subclass
   that communicates with Teambots.
