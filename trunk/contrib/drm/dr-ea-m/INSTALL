INSTALLATION GUIDE

Installation is very simple since you don't have to recompile anything
as the software is written in java. Eg it was succesfully installed on
a Mac OS X too which supports java 1.3 and BSD tools which the sripts
in linux/bin use to start up the applications.

IMPORTANT: Please do not use the Sun 1.4.0 version VM. It has a bug in the
binary format of internet addresses. We advise you to use either
version 1.3.1 or 1.4.1.

LINUX

Normally you have a good chance that the RPM distribution works
for you. At least the tools will always be installed as it involves
extracting a dir and linking some scripts into the system path.
Installing the automatically started contributor node might fail on
non-redht style systems.

Anyway, we describe the installation process in detail. The requirement is
that you have a java VM installed which supports at least java 1.3
and you have it in the path with the name "java".


1 Extract the distribution directory to the final place (if you already have,
  move it to its final place). The suggested place is /usr/dr-ea-m.

2 add the executables in the directory linux/bin to the path or link the
  scripts in it to a standard bin dir like /usr/bin.

3 If the name of the directory you chosen is different from /usr/dr-ea-m,
  say /home/foo/dr-ea-m, you have to add a file called drm.config into
  /etc, or into $HOME/.dream/ with the one line content

  DRM_HOME /home/foo/dr-ea-m

4 Optionally you can add a line like

  DRM_JVM /usr/java/j2sad1.4/bin/java

  if you want to set the required java VM explicitly.


You installation is ready if you don't want to contribute to the "big drm"
out there. If you do, you have to start a node in your login profile, or
at boot time. It is done by running "drmd.init start" in your startup
configuration. You can just include it in your profile, or (depending on
the convensions followed by your linux distribution) you can eg link
drmd.init into /etc/init.d and configure it to be started at the runlevels
you wish (on redhat style systems chkconfig).
You can stop this contributor node any time by saying "drmd.init stop".

IMPORTANT: if you start the contributor node at boot time, make sure
java is accessible and that drm.config is in /etc (or you installed
it into the default /usr/dr-ea-m) having in mind that your path settings are
not in effect yet at that time.
The same is true for the executables in linux/bin which also have to be
in a standard bin directory (linked or copied) like /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin.

Also, the environment variables DRM_HOME and DRM_JVM are understood
but of course not at boot time when they are not set yet.
