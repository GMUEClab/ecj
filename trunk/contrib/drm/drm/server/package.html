Package that implements user interfaces to the node.
It contains two applications.
The first is the <em>NakedNode</em> which is the simplest
possible application, it support command line and file-based configuration but
it is not interactive.
The second is TestGUINode which can be configured similarly to
NakedNode, but it is interactive providing the user with a basic GUI to
debug the
system itself or applications written for the system.
