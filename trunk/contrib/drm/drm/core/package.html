Package that implements the collective-based model of computation, and the
DRM.

A <em>collective</em> is a set of entities that work to reach a goal.
It contains a shared database of contributions, and commands.
The role of a member of a collective can be
<em>observer</em>, <em>contributor</em> or <em>controller</em>.
The observer can read the contribution and command databases, the contributor
can write the contributon database and the controller can write the command
database.

The package also defines the concept of a <em>node</em>, which is an agentbase
that is an observer, contributor and controller at the same time
in the collective called DRM (distriubted resource machine).
