Before you do anything else, please read the file "LICENSE",
located in this directory. It contains the software license
you are bound to if you wish to use this software -- note that
the license is not *quite* your normal open source license;
it requires you to make certain admissions about using ECJ in
your published research work.

Additionally, please see the following important files:

Makefile		Useful if you're running under UNIX


ECJ has two modules which rely on external facilities.  They
are both optional, but you need to delete the directories or
otherwise turn those features off in the Makefile:

- The teambots package relies on the Teambots simulator 
  from teambots.org.  As we're mostly using ECJ with MASON to
  do our simulations in-house now this package may soon go
  away unless we hear from others.  At any rate, you can get
  rid of it simply by deleting the ec/teambots directory.

- The GUI system relies in part on the JFreeChart and iText
  facilities from jfreechart.org (add the jfreechart*.jar and
  jcommon*.jar files to your CLASSPATH) and from
  http://www.lowagie.com/iText/ (add the itext*.jar file to
  your CLASSPATH).  The system does not require them but you
  will not be able to compile the charting facility without
  them.
