/**
   An ultralightweight, simple pool for threads.  All threads are daemon threads, and you should
   not start() them.  Instead, you should use the two provided methods in
   the pool, startThread() and joinAndReturnThread().  You may join() the thread only
   if you don't plan on handing it back into the ThreadPool via joinAndReturnThread()
   (we don't recommend it).
        
   <p>Java 5.0 has a concurrency package with a heavyweight thread pool.  Why not use it?
   Mostly to allow code which is still compatable with 1.4, that's all.
