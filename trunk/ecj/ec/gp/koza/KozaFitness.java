/**
 * KozaFitness is a Fitness which stores an individual's fitness as described in
 * Koza I.  Well, almost.  In KozaFitness, standardized fitness and raw fitness
 * are considered the same (there are different methods for them, but they return
 * the same thing).  Standardized fitness ranges from 0.0 inclusive (the best)
 * to infinity exclusive (the worst).  Adjusted fitness converts this, using
 * the formula adj_f = 1/(1+f), into a scale from 0.0 exclusive (worst) to 1.0
 * inclusive (best).  While it's the standardized fitness that is stored, it
 * is the adjusted fitness that is printed out.
 * This is all just convenience stuff anyway; selection methods
 * generally don't use these fitness values but instead use the betterThan
 * and equalTo methods.
