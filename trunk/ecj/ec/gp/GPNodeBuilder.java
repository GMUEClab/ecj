/**
 * GPNodeBuilder is a Prototype which defines the superclass for objects
 * which create ("grow") GP trees, whether for population initialization,
 * subtree mutation, or whatnot.  It defines a single abstract method, 
 * newRootedTree(...), which must be implemented to grow the tree.
 *
 * <p>GPNodeBuilder also provides some facilities for user-specification
 * of probabilities of various tree sizes, which the tree builder can use
 * as it sees fit (or totally ignore).  
 * There are two such facilities.  First, the user might
 * specify a minimum and maximum range for tree sizes to be picked from;
 * trees would likely be picked uniformly from this range.  Second, the
 * user might specify an array, <tt>num-sizes</tt> long, of probabilities of 
 * tree sizes, in order to give a precise probability distribution.

        swap-compatible with <i>type</i>.  When you build a brand-new
        tree out of GPNodes cloned from the
        prototypes stored in the GPNode[] arrays, you must remember
        to call resetNode() on each cloned GPNode.  This gives ERCs a chance

        <p>requestedSize is an
        optional argument which differs based on the GPNodeBuilder used.
        Typically it is set to a tree size that the calling method wants
        the GPNodeBuilder to produce; the GPNodeBuilder is not obligated to
        produce a tree of this size, but it should attempt to interpret this
        argument as appropriate for the given algorithm.  To indicate that
        you don't care what size the tree should be, you can pass NOSIZEGIVEN.
