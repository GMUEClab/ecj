/**
 * SlaveConnection.java
 *

 This class contains certain information associated with a slave: its name, connection socket,
 input and output streams, and the job queue.  Additionally, the class sets up an auxillary thread
 which reads and writes to the streams to talk to the slave in the background.  This thread uses
 the SlaveMonitor as its synchronization point (it sleeps with wait() and wakes up when notified()
 to do some work).
 
 <P>Generally SlaveConnection is only seen by communicates only with SlaveMonitor.
