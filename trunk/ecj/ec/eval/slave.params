parent.0 = master.params



# Specifies the IP address of the master, for the Slaves
# to connect.  Slaves need to be told this in their
# parameter files.  The example below sets it to localhost,
# which is probably not what you want.
eval.master.host = 127.0.0.1


# Specifies a slave's name for debugging purposes.  If this is not
# set (the default), then the system will use an approximately unique
# name constructed from the IP address and startup time of the
# slave.  Names don't have to be unique -- it's only for debugging.

# eval.slave.name = my-slave-name


# Specifies the mode the slave runs in.  If false, the slave runs in
# 'regular' mode where it just evaluates the individuals and returns
# either the fitnesses or the whole individuals.  If true, the slave
# runs in 'evolve' mode, where it evaluates the individuals, but then
# if there's extra time (see next parameter), it will treat the individuals
# as its own mini-population and do some evolution on that population
# according to the evolution parameters you provided the slave.  When
# the time is up, it then returns the entire individuals.
#
# You want to make sure that if you set this to true, then the mini-population
# on the slave is sufficiently large to support its own evolution.
# The population size is specified by eval.master-problem.job-size
# on the Master.
eval.slave.run-evolve = false


# Specifies the length of (wall clock) time, in milliseconds, that the
# slave should do "evolution" on its individuals if eval.run-evolve = true
eval.slave.runtime = 6000


# Change this to force whole Individuals to be returned by the
# Slave rather than just returning Fitnesses, plus whether or not the
# Individual was evaluated.  Returning a whole Individual is expensive
# over the network and should only be done if, for some reason, your
# Problem class modified the Individuals as it evaluates them.
eval.return-inds = false


# Set this to FALSE (it's true by default) to cause the slave to linger
# after the Master has terminated.  The slave will then wait for another
# Master to start up on that port and host and will then connect to it.
# Essentially we're creating a slave daemon.

# eval.slave.one-shot = false


# Set this to TRUE (it's false by default) to cause the slave to
# muzzle its stdout and stderr logs, effectively eliminating all
# printing to the screen.

# eval.slave.muzzle = true
