/**
 * JobQueue.java
 *

 The queue of jobs that are assigned to a slave (there is a one-to-one mapping between slaves and
 job queues.  The system keeps track of all jobs assigned to a slave such that, if that slave
 crashed, the jobs can be rescheduled for execution on other threads.  As evaluated individuals
 (or only their fitness) are read back from the slaves, the queue of jobs is continuously updated.
 For regular evolution, a job consists of an individual that needs to be evaluated, and as such,
 a job is removed from the queue of jobs each time an individual is read back from the slave.  On
 the other hand, coevolutionary settings involve multiple individuals that are evaluated together;
 in this case, the queue of jobs keeps track how many more individuals need to be read back from
 the slave before the current job is finished.  Of course, a slave that crashes in the middle of
 the run requires that the entire job needs to be rescheduled to another slave.

 The queue is a first-in-first-out data structure.  This implies that the jobs are expected to be
 read back from the slave in exactly the same order as they were sent there.
