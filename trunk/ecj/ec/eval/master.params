# When eval.masterproblem is turned on, the system assumes
# use of the master/slave evaluator.
eval.masterproblem = ec.eval.MasterProblem

# Turning this on will provide synchronization

# How many jobs do you hand to a slave in bulk?  
# A small number allows finer resolution of job distribution
# among the slaves, but may result in jobs being sent out
# in individual packets on the network (quite inefficient).
# If you have N slaves and need to distribute M jobs total
# (perhaps you have a population of size M?), then your
# max-jobs-per-slave should be no more than, and ideally a
# small fraction of, M/N.
eval.masterproblem.max-jobs-per-slave = 20

# This compresses the streams between the master and slaves.
# Compression at present is BROKEN and DOES NOT WORK RIGHT.
# This is because somewhere in JDK 1.5 Sun further broke their
# already broken zlib libraries, eliminating our ability to
# hack around them.  Until we get another zlib library up
# and running, don't use compression.

# This defines the socket port that the master listens in
# for incomoing Slaves to connect.

# Change this to force whole Individuals to be returned by the
# Slave rather than just returning Fitnesses, plus whether or not the
# Individual was evaluated.  Returning a whole Individual is expensive
# over the network and should only be done if, for some reason, your
# Problem class modified the Individuals as it evaluates them.

# OPTIONAL SLAVE PARAMETERS

# Lets the slaves know that they're slaves.  Slaves should
# have different parameter files than masters.
# eval.i-am-slave = true

# Specifies the IP address of the master, for the Slaves
# to connect.  Slaves need to be told this in their
# parameter files.  The example below sets it to localhost,
# which is probably not what you want.
# eval.master.host = 127.0.0.1

# Specifies a slave's name for debugging purposes.  If this is not
# set (the default), then the system will use an approximately unique
# name constructed from the IP address and startup time of the
# slave.  Names don't have to be unique -- it's only for debugging.
# eval.slave-name = my-slave-name
