# had a significant effect on network performance, but it doesn't
# any more.  Now it mostly serves to allow you to send out a large
# number of children before getting any back, which mostly has (likely
# negative) effects on steady-state evolution.  Unless you have a special
# reason to, keep this at 1 for the time being until we add some new code

# How large should our job be?  If you're doing ordinary
# non-coevolutionary evolution, you can specify how many individuals
# should be placed into a job (maximum) and sent to the slave
# to be evaluated at one time, using the below parameter.
# If your individuals are small in size, this can significantly
# improve the network bandwidth.  If the individuals are large
# in size, it'll have no real effect.  Furthermore, if your
# slave is running in 'evolve' mode, this parameter will determine
# the maximum (and typical) size of the "population" the slave is
# evolving.  This works for both steady-state and generational evolution,
# but if you're doing coevolution, the job size is ignored -- instead
# the job will consist of the individuals to be coevolved together.

# This compresses the streams between the master and slaves.
# Compression at present is BROKEN and DOES NOT WORK RIGHT.

# hack around them.  Until we get another zlib library up
# and running, don't use compression.

# Slave rather than just returning Fitnesses, plus whether or not the
# Individual was evaluated.  Returning a whole Individual is expensive

# Problem class modified the Individuals as it evaluates them.

# You do NOT want to set   eval.i-am-slave=true   in this file,
