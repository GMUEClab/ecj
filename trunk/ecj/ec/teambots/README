If you are reading this file, the 'teambots' directory is in
your distribution, and it shouldn't be.  It's a vestige of
teambots being part of the ECJ distro a long time ago.  Feel
free to delete this directory.

If you're interested in the original teambots<-->ECJ code,
it's available in the "contrib" section of the ECJ CVS repository.
