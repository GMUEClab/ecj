/**
 * An Evaluator is a singleton object which is responsible for the
 * evaluation process during the course of an evolutionary run.  Only
 * one Evaluator is created in a run, and is stored in the EvolutionState
 * object.
 *
 * <p>Evaluators typically do their work by applying an instance of some
 * subclass of Problem to individuals in the population.  Evaluators come
 * with a Problem prototype which they may clone as necessary to create
 * new Problem spaces to evaluate individuals in (Problems may be reused
 * to prevent constant cloning).
 *
 * <p>Evaluators may be multithreaded, with one Problem instance per thread
 * usually.  The number of threads they may spawn (excepting a parent
 * "gathering" thread) is governed by the EvolutionState's evalthreads value.
 *
 * <p>Be careful about spawning threads -- this system has no few synchronized 
 * methods for efficiency's sake, so you must either divvy up evaluation in 
 * a thread-safe fashion, or 
 * otherwise you must obtain the appropriate locks on individuals in the population
 * and other objects as necessary.
 *
