This package implements various Differential Evolution algorithms from
"Differential Evolution: A Practical Approach to Global Optimization"
by Kenneth Price, Rainer Storn, and Jouni Lampinen.  Much of the algorithms
were taken, with permission from the Differential Evolution website 
http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~storn/code.html

ECJ's implementation of Differential Evolution requires that the
user specify one of several Breeders, and also that the user include
a special Statistics object in the Statistics chain.  This Statistics
object must be the *first* such object in the chain -- other Statistics
objects must hang off of it.

The Breeder options implement various Differential Evolution Algorithms.
Options include:

breed = 	ec.de.DEBreeder
breed = 	ec.de.Best1BinDEBreeder
breed = 	ec.de.Rand1EitherOrDEBreeder
breed = 	ec.de.Rand1ExpDEBreeder

The Statistics object is ec.de.DEStatistics.  To use it in conjunction 
with ec.simple.SimpleStatistics, for example, we do:

stat =                                  ec.de.DEStatistics
stat.num-children =                     1
stat.child.0 =                          ec.simple.SimpleStatistics
stat.child.0.file =                     $out.stat

The ec/app/ecsuite/de.params file contains an example.
