/**
 * RuleSet is a set of Rules, implemented straightforwardly as an arbitrary-length array of Rules.
 * A RuleIndividual is simply a list of RuleSets.  Most typically, a RuleIndividual contains a
 * single RuleSet, containing a variety of Rules.
 * RuleSets contain many useful subsetting and modification functions which you can use
 * in breeding operators which modify RuleSets and Rules.
 *
 * <p> Besides the Rules themselves, the only thing else a RuleSet contains is a pointer to a
 * corresponding RuleSetConstraints object, which holds all of its modification parameters.
 * See RuleSetConstraints for a description of these parameters.

 * <p>In addition to serialization for checkpointing, RuleSets may read and write themselves to streams in three ways.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>writeRuleSet(...,DataOutput)/readRuleSet(...,DataInput)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This method
 * transmits or receives a RuleSet in binary.  It is the most efficient approach to sending
 * RuleSets over networks, etc.  The default versions of writeRuleSet/readRuleSet reads/writes out the number
 * of rules, then calls read/writeRule(...) on each Rule.  Override this if you need more functionality.
 *
 * <li><b>printRuleSet(...,PrintWriter)/readRuleSet(...,LineNumberReader)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
 * approach transmits or receives a RuleSet in text encoded such that the RuleSet is largely readable
 * by humans but can be read back in 100% by ECJ as well.  To do this, these methods will typically encode numbers
 * using the <tt>ec.util.Code</tt> class.  These methods are mostly used to write out populations to
 * files for inspection, slight modification, then reading back in later on.  <b>readRuleSet</b>
 * reads in the number of rules, then calls readRule(...) on each new Rule.  <b>printRuleSet</b> writes
 * out the number of rules, then calls printrule(...) on each new Rule.  Again, override this if you need more
 * functionality.
 * 
 * <li><b>printRuleSetForHumans(...,PrintWriter)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
 * approach prints a RuleSet in a fashion intended for human consumption only.
 * <b>printRuleSetForHumans</b> prints out the number of rules, then calles <b>printRuleForHumans</b>
 * on each Rule in turn.  You may wish to override this to provide more information instead. 
 * You should handle one of these methods properly
 * to ensure RuleSets can be printed by ECJ.
 * </ul>
