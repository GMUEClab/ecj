/**
 * Setup classes are classes which get set up once from user-supplied parameters
 * prior to being used.
 *
 * Defines a single method, setup(...), which is called at least once for the
 * object, or for some object from which it was cloned.  This method
 * allows the object to set itself up by reading from parameter lists and
 * files on-disk.  You may assume that this method is called in a non-threaded
 * environment, hence your thread number is 0 (so you can determine which
 * random number generator to use).
