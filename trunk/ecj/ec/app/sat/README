The boolean satisfiability problem can have widly different levels of
difficulty.  To that end, this directory contains three different
problems.  All the problems are 3CNF, and were generated using the Mkcnf
program from ftp://dimacs.rutgers.edu/pub/challenge/satisfiability/contributed/UCSC/instances/Cnfgen.tar.Z. 
See the README file in that package for instructions on buliding and
usage.

The three problems included here have 10, 215, and 1000 clauses, and are
known to be satisfiable.  So, the maximum fitness is 10, 215, and 1000. 
All problems have 50 variables (so a genome length of 50). 

Note that the problem file is assumed to be in DIMACS format.  See
http://www.satlib.org/Benchmarks/SAT/satformat.ps for more information. 
Mkcnf can generate arbitrary, satisfiable CNF formulas in DIMACS format.
