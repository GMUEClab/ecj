				Tutorial 2: Build a Genetic Algorithm for an Integer Problem
			</h2>
			<p>
			In the second tutorial, we will build a generational GA for a problem requiring our individuals to be integer vectors.  The tutorial will also delve into many specific aspects of ECJ, including how to use parameter files and parent parameters, the relationship between species and individuals, how to make custom breeding operators and pipelines, how to run with more than one thread of execution, how to base the seeds on the wall clock time, and how to print out parameter information. 
			<p>
			If you've not done <a href="../tutorial1">Tutorial 1</a>, I suggest you do so.
			<h3>
				Create an app subdirectory and parameters file
			</h3>
			<p>
			Go into the <tt>ec/app</tt> directory and create a directory called <tt>tutorial2</tt>. In this directory, create a file called <tt>tutorial2.params</tt>. In this file, add as a first line the following: <tt>
			<pre>
parent.0		= ../../simple/simple.params
</pre>
			</tt>
			<p>
			This specifies that <tt>../../simple/simple.params </tt> will be the <b>first parent</b> of our parameter file. This means that if the parameter is not specified in <tt>tutorial.params</tt>, ECJ will next look in <tt>../../simple/simple.params</tt> to find that parameter.
			<p>
			<img src="hierarchy.jpg" valign=top align=right> As discussed in the <a href="../../parameters.html">introduction to Parameter files</a>, ECJ has a particular way of looking up parameters. When a parameter is requested by the system, ECJ tries the following in order:
			<ol>
				<li>ECJ looks to see if it was <b>dynamically set</b> by the system at some point by something which directly called the <tt>set</tt> method in the <a href="../classodcs/ec/util/ParameterDatabase.html">ec.util.ParameterDatabase</a>. In ECJ, this presently never occurs (no class directly sets values in the database).
				<li>ECJ looks to see if the user had specified the parameter on the command line with the <tt>-p</tt> option.
				<li>ECJ looks in the root <tt>params</tt> file that was specified on the command line with the <tt>-file</tt> option.
				<li>ECJ starts looking through parent parameter files specified with <tt>parent.<i>x</i></tt> declarations, starting with those declared in the root. The figure at right shows an example. This is done in a depth-first, left-to-right, preorder fashion. The rule is: a parameter file is checked before its parent parameter files are checked, and <tt>parent.<i>x</i></tt> and its parents are checked before <tt>parent.<i>x+1</i></tt> and its parents are checked. In case you were wondering, <tt>0</tt> is the smallest legal value of <tt><i>x</i></tt>.
			</ol>
			<p>
			Most ECJ packages have parameter files which lay out some default parameters to help you get started, so you don't have to type them in yourself. The <tt>../../simple/simple.params</tt> file in particular lays out common parameter settings. It lays out a lot of parameters which had to be explicitly specified in Tutorial 1, namely:
			<p>

			<p>
			These parameters specify a standard generational evolution procedure, with a very basic statistics object, a single subpopulation of 1024 individuals, 51 generations, and a simple, one-objective Fitness. The statistics object writes out to the <tt>out.stat</tt> file, located in the directory where we issued our command (that's what the $ is for -- without it, it'd be located in the directory where the <tt>simple.params</tt> file was located).
			<p>
			Some of these parameters are inappropriate for a genetic algorithm: in the <tt>tutorial2.params</tt> file, we'll override two of them: <tt>
			<pre>
pop.subpop.0.size = 100
generations = 200

			<tt>simple.params</tt> in turn relies on a parent of its own: <tt>ec.params</tt>, located in the <tt>ec</tt> directory. <tt>ec.params</tt> specifies the following default parameter settings for us, so we don't have to:

			</table>
			<p>
			You'll notice these are the same parameters that we typed in by hand in Tutorial 1. Now we don't have to. So what <i>do</i> we have to specify? Mostly, we have to specify the representation, problem domain, and breeding pipeline.
			<h3>
				Define the Representation -- And All About Species
			</h3>
			<p>
			Our representation this time will be a vector of 20 integers. The integer values will be permitted to range from -12312 to 2341212 (why those values? Why not?). We begin by specifying the individual, an <a href="../../classdocs/ec/vector/IntegerVectorIndividual.html">ec.vector.IntegerVectorIndividual</a>. <tt>
			<pre>
pop.subpop.0.species		= ec.vector.IntegerVectorSpecies
pop.subpop.0.species.ind	= ec.vector.IntegerVectorIndividual
pop.subpop.0.species.fitness = ec.simple.SimpleFitness
</pre>
			</tt>
			<p>
			IntegerVectorIndividuals, among others, use a special species called <a href="../../classdocs/ec/vector/IntegerVectorSpecies.html">ec.vector.IntegerVectorSpecies</a>. Species objects are set up in a one-to-many arrangement with Individuals: a subpopulation of Individuals will all share the same Species instance. The basic purpose of a Species object is to provide a place where you can store non-constant information that needs to be shared among all the Individuals in subpopulation. You'll see this many-to-one pattern in lots of other places.
			<p>
			Why not just store shared information as static member variables directly in IntegerVectorIndividual? Two reasons. First, static variables are very difficult to serialize, and that messes up ECJ's checkpointing. Second, this would tie storage to a given class name. Let's say you have two subpopulations, both with IntegerVectorIndividual, but one subpopulation consists of individuals whose genes range from -1 to 4 and the other subpopulation consists of individuals whose genes range from -10 to 10. If the global min and max values are stored as class variables in IntegerVectorIndividual, then you've got a problem. But if they're separately stored in shared Species instances, each group can have its own Species.
			<p>
			Why not just store shared information in the Subpopulation? After all, all the individuals belong to the same subpopulation, right? That's true, but only for that generation. Subpopulations are <i>groups</i> which are very similar in function to <i>prototypes</i>: Subpopulations can create new Subpopulations. We need a more permanent storage facility.
			<p>
			IntegerVectorSpecies is a subclass of <a href="../../classdocs/ec/vector/VectorSpecies.html">ec.vector.VectorSpecies</a> (which we used in Tutorial 1 for our BitVectorIndividuals). VectorSpecies is in turn a subclass of <a href="../../classdocs/ec/Species.html">ec.Species</a>. As stipulated in its documentation, IntegerVectorSpecies requires two parameters: <tt>min-gene</tt> and <tt>max-gene</tt>, which specify the minimum and maximum values the integers may take on. You can also specify them on a gene-by-gene basis, but we'll just do a default for all genes as: <tt>
			<pre>
# Note that min-gene and max-gene are defined in the SPECIES, not in the INDIVIDUAL
pop.subpop.0.species.min-gene	= -12312
pop.subpop.0.species.max-gene 	= 2341212	
</pre>
			</tt>
			<p>
			VectorSpecies requires some parameters: the genome size, the chunk size (which specifies crossover boundaries -- usually it's just 1), the crossover type (if we do crossover), the probability that uniform crossover (if we use it) will cross over a gene, and the probability that a gene will get mutated (if we do mutation). We enter them as follows: <tt>
			<pre>
pop.subpop.0.species.genome-size	= 20
pop.subpop.0.species.crossover-type	= two
pop.subpop.0.species.crossover-prob	= 1.0
pop.subpop.0.species.mutation-prob	= 0.05
</pre>
			</tt>
			<p>
			We don't need to specify the chunk size -- it'll by default be set to 1 for us. The parameters above say that the genome consists of 20 integers, we'll use two-point crossover (so <tt>crossover-prob</tt> doesn't really matter), and we'll mutate with a gene-independent probability of <tt>0.05</tt>.
			<p>
			Besides <tt>ind</tt>, Species has parameters which specify the breeding pipeline. Let's do that next.
			<H3>
				Specify the Breeding Pipeline
			</H3>
			<p>
			To introduce various new features, we'll design a preposterous breeding pipeline. The pipeline will pick two parents, one by fitness proportionate selection, and one through a tournament selection (of size 5) which always returns the <i>worst</i> individual in the tournament. These two parents will be crossed over (using two-point crossover as specified above), but only the child of the first parent will be used (the other will be thrown away). The child will then be mutated, with our specified gene-by-gene 0.05 probability, but the mutation procedure will flip the minus-sign of the integer, and that's all. Don't expect this to optimize very well! :-)
			<p>
			We begin at the end, by specifying a custom mutation class (which we'll make later): <tt>
			<pre>
# Use our own custom mutation class
pop.subpop.0.species.pipe = ec.app.tutorial2.OurMutatorPipeline
pop.subpop.0.species.pipe.source.0	= ec.vector.breed.VectorCrossoverPipeline
# Toss the second child
pop.subpop.0.species.pipe.source.0.toss = true
pop.subpop.0.species.pipe.source.0.source.0 = ec.select.FitProportionateSelection
pop.subpop.0.species.pipe.source.0.source.1 = ec.select.TournamentSelection
pop.subpop.0.species.pipe.source.0.source.1.size = 5
# Pick the worst individual in the tournament
pop.subpop.0.species.pipe.source.0.source.1.pick-worst = true
</pre>
			</tt>
			<p>
			Now we have to write the mutation class. In the <tt>tutorial2</tt> directory, create a file called <tt>OurMutatorPipeline.java</tt>.  Add the following to the file:

<tt><pre>
package ec.app.tutorial2;
import ec.vector.*;
import ec.*;
import ec.util.*;

<font color=gray>/*
 * OurMutatorPipeline.java
 */

/**
 OurMutatorPipeline is a BreedingPipeline which negates the sign of genes.
 The individuals must be IntegerVectorIndividuals.  Because we're lazy,
 we'll use the individual's species' mutation-probability parameter to tell
 us whether or not to mutate a given gene.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Number of Sources&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 1
*/</font>
public class OurMutatorPipeline extends BreedingPipeline
    {
</pre></tt>

<p>OurMutatorPipeline is a <a href="../../classdocs/ec/BreedingPipeline.html">BreedingPipeline</a>, which means it is a non-leaf node in the breeding pipeline tree, responsible not for selection of individuals but for modification of whatever is handed to it.  BreedingPipelines are <a href="../../classdocs/ec/Prototype/">ec.Prototype</a>s and so must define various methods, most of which have (empty) default implementations in BreedingPipeline for you, to make implementation easier for you..  The only Prototype method which is not explicitly handled is <tt>defaultBase(...)</tt>, which specifies the default parameter dabase for OurMutatorPipeline.  Since we have no parameters
	    that we're loading (we're stealing the mutation-probability parameter from elsewhere), there's no
		need for a base, but we define a simple one anyway:

<tt><pre>
    <font color=gray>//used only for our default base</font>
    public static final String P_OURMUTATION = "our-mutation";

    <font color=gray>// We have to specify a default base, even though we never use it</font>
    public Parameter defaultBase() { return VectorDefaults.base().push(P_OURMUTATION); }
 </pre></tt>
   
 <p>Next, BreedingPipeline stipulates that we have to state how many sources our breeding pipeline must have (it can be variable or a fixed number).  In our case, we have just a single breeding source.  We take all our individuals from that source and mutate them and return them.

<tt><pre>
    public static final int NUM_SOURCES = 1;

    <font color=gray>// Return 1 -- we only use one source</font>
    public int numSources() { return NUM_SOURCES; }
 </pre></tt>

 <p>Here's the main part of the class.  We have to implement the <tt>produce(...)</tt> method, which fills an array with "bred" individuals and returns it.  We get those individuals by asking our source for them, then mutating them as we please.  The method looks like this:

<tt><pre>
    <font color=gray>// We're supposed to create a most _max_ and at least _min_ individuals,
    // drawn from our source and mutated, and stick them into slots in inds[]
    // starting with the slot inds[start].  Let's do this by telling our 
    // source to stick those individuals into inds[] and then mutating them
    // right there.  produce(...) returns the number of individuals actually put into inds[]</font>
    public int produce(final int min, 
		       final int max, 
		       final int start,
		       final int subpopulation,
		       final Individual[] inds,
		       final EvolutionState state,
		       final int thread) throws CloneNotSupportedException
        {
 </pre></tt>

<p>The <tt>CloneNotSupportedException</tt> is there because in some situations produce(...) might use a clone(...) method call.  In this example, we don't.

<p>The easy way to mutate is to just ask our source to stick those individuals into <tt>inds[]</tt>, and then mutate them.  We also have to make sure that they're they're copies -- we don't want to stick original individuals from the previous population into the next one.  This is a guarantee that all BreedingPipelines must make.  We keep this guarantee by checking to see what our source is.  If it's
			a BreedingPipeline too, it already copied the individuals for us (keeping <i>it's</i> guarantee).  If
		  it's a SelectionMethod, the individuals aren't copies but originals, so we need to copy them.

<p>First we need to figure out how many individuals we'll produce.  We can do this in two ways.  First, we could compute how many individuals we want beforehand: for example, Crossover operations typicaly produce two individuals no matter what, unless they're forced to (say) produce a single individual.  But since we're making a mutator, we'll take a different tack: we simply ask our sources to produce some number of individuals (their choice), then we mutate all those individuals and return them.  In this case, we first produce the individuals, and the variable <b>n</b> is set to how many were created:


<tt><pre>
        <font color=gray>// grab individuals from our source and stick 'em right into inds.
        // we'll modify them from there</font>
        int n = sources[0].produce(min,max,start,subpopulation,inds,state,thread);
</pre></tt>

<p>Next we need to determine if we should bother mutating these individuals at all.  With a certain probability we will just return the individuals unmutated:

<tt><pre>
	<font color=gray>// should we bother?</font>
	if (!state.random[thread].nextBoolean(likelihood))
		<font color=gray>// DON'T produce children from source -- we already did</font>
		return reproduce(n, start, subpopulation, inds, state, thread, false);
</pre></tt>

<p>If we've gotten this far, it's time to actually mutate the individuals we got from our source.  We'll first
copy them if the source isn't a BreedingPipeline.  
Copying is done through the <tt>clone()</tt> method.  This is a method in Individual which is guaranteed to creat
e a deep clone of the individual, including its Fitness.  In some situations (such as crossing over GPIndividuals, w
here cloning the individual is very expensive) you may wish to light clone the Individual, then clone parts of it as
 necessary.  In that case you can judiciously use <tt>lightClone()</tt> instead.  But that's not very common.

<tt><pre>
        <font color=gray>// clone the individuals if necessary -- if our source is a BreedingPipeline
        // they've already been cloned, but if the source is a SelectionMethod, the
        // individuals are actual individuals from the previous population</font>
        if (!(sources[0] instanceof BreedingPipeline))
            for(int q=start;q&lt;n+start;q++)
                inds[q] = (Individual)(inds[q].deepClone());
 </pre></tt>

<p>Next we'll test to make certain that the individuals are in fact IntegerVectorIndividuals.  It's a quick hack of a test, not a complete one, but usually the complete one is unnecessary.  We'll also extract
	the IntegerVectorSpecies object the individuals are sharing, so we can get the <tt>mutationProbability</tt>
	value out of it.

<tt><pre>
        <font color=gray>// Check to make sure that the individuals are IntegerVectorIndividuals and
        // grab their species.  For efficiency's sake, we assume that all the 
        // individuals in inds[] are the same type of individual and that they all
        // share the same common species -- this is a safe assumption because they're 
        // all breeding from the same subpopulation.</font>

        if (!(inds[start] instanceof IntegerVectorIndividual)) 
            <font color=gray>// uh oh, wrong kind of individual</font>
            state.output.fatal("OurMutatorPipeline didn't get an " +
            "IntegerVectorIndividual.  The offending individual is " +
            "in subpopulation " + subpopulation + " and it's:" + inds[start]);
        IntegerVectorSpecies species = (IntegerVectorSpecies)(inds[start].species);
 </pre></tt>

<p>Now we're ready to go through the individuals and mutate them.  For each gene in each individual,
we'll flip a coin of <tt>mutationProbability</tt>, and change the sign of the gene if it comes up heads.
We set the flag in the individual indicating that its evaluation is invalid and needs to be reevaluated.
Finally, we'll return the number of individuals we created (<tt>n</tt>), and the class is done:

<tt><pre>
        <font color=gray>// mutate 'em!</font>
        for(int q=start;q&lt;n+start;q++)
            {
            IntegerVectorIndividual i = (IntegerVectorIndividual)inds[q];
            for(int x=0;x&lt;i.genome.length;x++)
                if (state.random[thread].nextBoolean(species.mutationProbability))
                    i.genome[x] = -i.genome[x];
            <font color=gray>// it's a "new" individual, so it's no longer been evaluated</font>
            i.evaluated=false;
            }
        return n;
        }
     }
</pre></tt>

<h3>Define the Problem</h3>

For our problem, we'll define a problem which alternately adds and subtracts genes, then takes the absolute value of the result as the fitness.  Create a file called "AddSubtract.java".  In this file, add (similar to Tutorial 1):

<tt><pre>
package ec.app.tutorial2;
import ec.*;
import ec.simple.*;
import ec.util.*;
import ec.vector.*;

public class AddSubtract extends Problem implements SimpleProblemForm
    {
    public void evaluate(final EvolutionState state,
                         final Individual ind,
                         final int subpopulation,
                         final int threadnum)
        {
        if (ind.evaluated) return;

        if (!(ind instanceof IntegerVectorIndividual))
            state.output.fatal("Whoa!  It's not a IntegerVectorIndividual!!!",null);
        
        IntegerVectorIndividual ind2 = (IntegerVectorIndividual)ind;
</pre></tt>

<p>Now we add/subtract genes to get our fitness:

<tt><pre>
        int rawfitness = 0;
        for(int x=0; x&lt;ind2.genome.length; x++)
            if (x % 2 == 0) rawfitness += ind2.genome[x];
                else rawfitness -= ind2.genome[x];
</pre></tt>

<p>I have no idea what the ideal fitness here is.  Plus with our odd mutation operator, it's unlikely we'll get it.  So let's bypass the issue and just state that individuals are NEVER ideal -- even if they are.
	We finish out with:

<tt><pre>
        <font color=gray>// We finish by taking the ABS of rawfitness as mentioned.  By the way,
        // in SimpleFitness, fitness values must be set up so that 0 is &lt;= the worst
        // fitness and +infinity is &gt;= the ideal possible fitness.  Our raw fitness
        // value here satisfies this. </font>
        if (rawfitness &lt; 0) rawfitness = -rawfitness;
        if (!(ind2.fitness instanceof SimpleFitness))
            state.output.fatal("Whoa!  It's not a SimpleFitness!!!",null);
        ((SimpleFitness)ind2.fitness).setFitness(state,
                <font color= gray >// what the heck, lets normalize the fitness for genome length
                // so it's within float range</font>
                (float)(((double)rawfitness)/ind2.genome.length),
                <font color= gray >//... is the individual ideal?  Indicate here...</font>
                false);
        ind2.evaluated = true;
        }
    }
</pre></tt>

<p>Save the file, and compile both Java files in the <tt>tutorial2</tt> directory.  Add the following parameters to the <tt>tutorial2.params</tt> file to specify that we're using AddSubtract as our Problem:

<tt><pre>
eval.problem            = ec.app.tutorial2.AddSubtract
</pre></tt>

<h3>Run the Experiment</h3>

<p>Run the problem by going into the <tt>tutorial2</tt> directly and typing the command (at least on a UNIX box):

<tt><pre>
java ec.Evolve -file tutorial2.params
</pre></tt>

<p>Because Java no longer guarantees exact floating point results, the final result may vary from platform to platform, but as far as I am aware, the only JVM which gives different results from the others is Microsoft's JVM.  On a non-Microsoft JVM the last few lines of the out.stat file says

<tt><pre>
Best Individual of Run:

<p>Now, let's run this with two simulataneous threads.  This would be useful in particular if you have a multiprocessor computer. You can multithread the evaluation process, the breeding process, or both.  Let's do both.  When you have more than one thread, you need to have more than one seed.  We have only specified one seed (seed.0=4357).  So we'll need to specify a second one.  We'll add the parameters on the command line, though of course you could add them to your parameter file:

<tt><pre>
java ec.Evolve -file tutorial2.params -p breedthreads=2 -p evalthreads=2 -p seed.1=1234
</pre></tt>

<p>With two threads, the second one starting with seed 1234, we now get the following best individual:

<p>Even though the process is multithreaded, it's been arranged so that the results will be the same across runs with the same initial seeds.  Try running it again and see for yourself.

<p>ECJ, under most conditions, is <b>guaranteed deterministic</b>.  That means that every time ECJ is run, you'll get the same results for the same parameter settings and seeds.  Perhaps you'd like ECJ to differ each time you run it.  The <b>good</b> way to do this is to set an explicit new seed each run.  But you can <i>also</i> just tell ECJ to base the seeds on the current timer.  For example, we could set both seeds to timer values and run multithreaded like this:

<tt><pre>
java ec.Evolve -file tutorial2.params -p breedthreads=2 -p evalthreads=2 -p seed.1=time -p seed.0=time
</pre></tt>

<p>Notice that the seeds wind up being different from each other, even though both are based on the current number of milliseconds.  One last thing.  If you add the parameter <tt>print-params=true</tt>, as ECJ requests parameters from the database, the database will print out the parameters and their values.  This helps you see what parameters are actually being used  For example, if you issue the following:

<tt><pre>
java ec.Evolve -file tutorial2.params -p print-params=true
</pre></tt>

<p>You are likely to get the following back:

<tt><pre>
        P: store = true
        P: flush = true
        P: breedthreads = 1
        P: evalthreads = 1
        P: seed.0 = 4357
        P: seed.0 = 4357
        P: state = ec.simple.SimpleEvolutionState
