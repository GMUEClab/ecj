			Tutorial 4: Build a Multivalued Genetic Programming Symbolic Regression Problem
			</h2>
			<p>
			In the fourth tutorial, we will use Koza-style GP to evolve solutions to a simple multivalued symbolic regression problem.  This will walk through many of the complexities of evolving s-expression trees.  We will also learn how to print out trees in a variety of formats, including ones readable by LaTeX.  We'll also add a dash of elitism to the traditional Koza breeding mix.
<h3>Create an app subdirectory</h3>

<p>Go into the <tt>ec/app</tt> directory and create a directory called <tt>tutorial4</tt>.

<h3>How ECJ's GP System Works</h3>

<p>[This sections assumes you are familiar with Koza-style genetic programming]

<p>
<img valign=top align=right src="GPGraph.png">
ECJ implements genetic programming individuals as forests of trees.  Each tree is implemented as a tree of <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/GPNode.html">GPNode</a>s.  A <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/GPIndividual.html">GPIndividual</a> is a subclass of Individual which holds an array of <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/GPTree.html">GPTree</a>s.  In most GP problems, the GPIndividual uses <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/koza/KozaFitness">KozaFitness</a>, a Fitness subclass which implements Koza's raw and standardized fitness and hits measure.
 
<p>A GPTree contains a pointer to the root GPNode of its tree.  GPNodes contain an array of pointers to their children in the tree.  At present, all GPNodes contain this array, even the terminals, for whom the array is of zero length.  For convenience, GPNodes also maintain a pointer to their parent in the tree (always a GPNode, except the root's parent, which is the owning GPTree) and an integer indicating which number child they are of their parent (their <tt>argposition</tt>).

<p>The species of GPIndividuals is <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/GPSpecies.html">GPSpecies</a>.  Just as Individuals have a many-to-one relationship with Species in order to provide a global storage area, GPTrees and GPNodes also have many-to-one relationships with <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/GPTreeConstraints.html">GPTreeConstraints</a> and <a href="../../gp/GPNodeConstraints.html">GPNodeConstraints</a> objects.  At present the primary function of these "constraints" objects is to specify the arity of the respective GPNodes, and to specify the <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/GPType.html">GPType</a>s associated with the GPNodes and GPTrees.

<p>ECJ supports <i>atomic</i> and <i>set-based</i> strong typing in order to place constraints on where various GPNodes may appear in the tree. Atomic strong typing assigns an atomic symbol to each return value and argument slot of a GPNode, and to the return value of the GPTree. GPNodes are permitted to be children of other GPNode if the return value type symbol of the child GPNode matches the relevant argument slot type symbol of the parent. Similarly, a GPNode is permitted to be the root if its return value type symbol matches the return value type symbol of the GPTree.  Atomic types are defined with a subclass of GPType called <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/GPAtomicType.html">GPAtomicType</a>.

<p>Set-based strong typing extends the notion of matching. Types are no longer just atomic symbols can also be sets of atomic symbols. A set matches with another set if their intersection is nonempty. A set matches with an atomic symbol if the atomic symbol is found in the set. Set types are defined with a subclass of GPType called <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/GPSetType.html">GPSetType</a>.
Set-based strong typing is sufficient for a wide variety of needs, including type inheritance (subclassing) and certain forms of general types. Set-based typing is not full polymorphic typing: for example, it assumes that the number of types is finite, so ECJ's typing facility is not appropriate for matrix multiplication operators, etc.

<p>While ECJ supports strong typing, in fact most GP applications only need a single type (they are "typeless").  For convenience, ECJ's default parameter files for GP define a single type called (for want of a better name) <b>nil</b>, and some default GPNodeConstraints of various arities which only use the type <b>nil</b> 

<p>Each GPTree subscribes to a <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/GPFunctionSet.html">GPFunctionSet</a> which defines the GPNodes legally permitted in the tree.  GPFunctionSets store, in a variety of redundant tables, the relevant GPNodes.  When an algorithm needs to generate a tree, it does so by finding the appropriate GPFunctionSet choosing GPNodes from the set, and cloning them to produce nodes to hang in the tree.

<p>GP builds trees using tree generation algorithms, all of which are subclasses of <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/GPNodeBuilder.html">GPNodeBuilder</a>.   Tree generation algorithms are usually used in one of two places: population initialization and mutation.  Mutation algorithms have their own parameters where you can specify the GPNodeBuilder subclass you'd like.  Additionally, each GPTree has a reference (not shown on the graph) to a GPNodeBuilder resonsible for initialization of that tree.

<p>ECJ's GP package has its own special <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/GPInitializer.html">GPInitializer</a> subclass of Initializer.  The reason for this is that GP needs <i>some</i> location to set up the GPFunctionSets, GPTreeConstraints, and GPNodeConstraints before evolution begins.  Initializer is the most obvious location.

The <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/koza/">ec.gp.koza</a> package adds the Koza-specific features to the general notion of tree-based genetic programming.  

<h3>Define the GPData Object</h3>

<p>Whew!

<p>What we will do is use GPTrees to evolve s-expression parse trees representing two-variable equations.  Our function set will contain five GPNodes representing the functions <b>add (+), sub (-), mul (*), X,</b> and <b>Y</b>.  The objective is to evolve an equation most closing a set of &lt;X,Y,f(X,Y)&gt; data.

<p>We begin by defining a GPData object. This object will be passed from GPNodes to their children, and usually more importantly, from the children back to the parents (storing the child node's return value after the child is evaluated).  It provides a general mechanism for nodes to transfer information to one another.

<p>In our case, we're interested only in the return values of GPNodes, and those values are <tt>double</tt>s.  So we'll make a GPData object which consists solely of a double.  Create a file called <b>DoubleData.java</b>.  In this file add:

<tt><pre>
package ec.app.tutorial4;
import ec.util.*;
import ec.*;
import ec.gp.*;

public class DoubleData extends GPData
    {
    public double x;    <font color=gray>// return value</font>

    public void copyTo(final GPData gpd)   <font color=gray>// copy my stuff to another DoubleData</font>
        { ((DoubleData)gpd).x = x; }
    }
</pre></tt>

<h3>Define the Function Set</h3>

Next, let's start writing the functions.

<p><b>Add.</b>  Create a file called <b>Add.java</b>.  In this file add:

<tt><pre>
package ec.app.tutorial4;
import ec.*;
import ec.gp.*;
import ec.util.*;

public class Add extends GPNode
    {
    public String toString() { return "+"; }

    public void checkConstraints(final EvolutionState state,
                                 final int tree,
                                 final GPIndividual typicalIndividual,
                                 final Parameter individualBase)
        {
        super.checkConstraints(state,tree,typicalIndividual,individualBase);
        if (children.length!=2)
            state.output.error("Incorrect number of children for node " + 
                               toStringForError() + " at " +
                               individualBase);
        }
</pre></tt>

<p>Add needs to specify its printed form ("+"), and a function (checkConstraints(...) ) which give <b>Add</b> a chance to do a sanity check when first loaded.  This is usually used to verify that the child array size is correct.

<p>Next we will define the central function to the GPNode: the <b>eval</b> method, which is called when the GPNode must do its part during the execution of the tree as s-expression computer code.  <b>eval</b> is called by the GPNode's parent to execute the GPNode and get its return value.

<p>The <b>eval</b> method is passed a bunch of stuff, including the EvolutionState, the current thread number (so you can get a random number via <tt>state.random[thread]</tt>, an <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/ADFStack.html">ADFStack</a> (don't worry about this -- just pass it on to your children), the GPIndividual which is executing, the Problem which is executing the GPIndividual, and the <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/GPData.html">GPData</a> used to pass information to and from the GPNode's parent.

<p>Here we go:

<tt><pre>
    public void eval(final EvolutionState state,
                     final int thread,
                     final GPData input,
                     final ADFStack stack,
                     final GPIndividual individual,
                     final Problem problem)
        {
        double result;
        DoubleData rd = ((DoubleData)(input));

        children[0].eval(state,thread,input,stack,individual,problem);
        result = rd.x;

        children[1].eval(state,thread,input,stack,individual,problem);
        rd.x = result + rd.x;
        }
    }
</pre></tt>

<p>What we're doing here is simple enough: we evaluate our left child, then we evaluate our right child, then we add the two together and return that result.  Note that we reuse the GPData object rather than allocating new ones.  You are free to allocate a new GPData object to pass to your children, but you should use the GPData object provided you when you return a value to your parent.  But I suggest you reuse the GPData object to keep from allocating millions of objects during evaluation.

<p><b>Sub and Mul.</b>  These functions are set up nearly identically.  Create a file called <b>Sub.java</b> and add to it the following:

<tt><pre>
package ec.app.tutorial4;
import ec.*;
import ec.gp.*;
import ec.util.*;

public class Sub extends GPNode
    {
    public String toString() { return "-"; }

    public void checkConstraints(final EvolutionState state,
                                 final int tree,
                                 final GPIndividual typicalIndividual,
                                 final Parameter individualBase)
        {
        super.checkConstraints(state,tree,typicalIndividual,individualBase);
        if (children.length!=2)
            state.output.error("Incorrect number of children for node " + 
                               toStringForError() + " at " +
                               individualBase);
        }
    public void eval(final EvolutionState state,
                     final int thread,
                     final GPData input,
                     final ADFStack stack,
                     final GPIndividual individual,
                     final Problem problem)
        {
        double result;
        DoubleData rd = ((DoubleData)(input));

        children[0].eval(state,thread,input,stack,individual,problem);
        result = rd.x;

        children[1].eval(state,thread,input,stack,individual,problem);
        rd.x = result - rd.x;
        }
    }
</pre></tt>

<p>Similarly, create a file called <b>Mul.java</b>, and add to it:

<tt><pre>
package ec.app.tutorial4;
import ec.*;
import ec.gp.*;
import ec.util.*;

public class Mul extends GPNode
    {
    public String toString() { return "*"; }

    public void checkConstraints(final EvolutionState state,
                                 final int tree,
                                 final GPIndividual typicalIndividual,
                                 final Parameter individualBase)
        {
        super.checkConstraints(state,tree,typicalIndividual,individualBase);
        if (children.length!=2)
            state.output.error("Incorrect number of children for node " + 
                               toStringForError() + " at " +
                               individualBase);
        }
    public void eval(final EvolutionState state,
                     final int thread,
                     final GPData input,
                     final ADFStack stack,
                     final GPIndividual individual,
                     final Problem problem)
        {
        double result;
        DoubleData rd = ((DoubleData)(input));

        children[0].eval(state,thread,input,stack,individual,problem);
        result = rd.x;

        children[1].eval(state,thread,input,stack,individual,problem);
        rd.x = result * rd.x;
        }
    }
</pre></tt>

<p><b>X and Y</b>.  So far we have defined <i>nonterminals</i> (nonleaf nodes in the tree), all of which have arity 2.  Now we'll finish by defining two <i>terminals</i> (leaf nodes in the tree) which of course have arity 0 (no children).  Before a tree is evaluated, the <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> values will be set, then as the tree is evaluated, the <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> terminals will simply return these values when they are evaluated.  We begin by creating a file called <b>X.java</b> and adding to it:

<tt><pre>
package ec.app.tutorial4;
import ec.*;
import ec.gp.*;
import ec.util.*;

public class X extends GPNode
    {
    public String toString() { return "x"; }

    public void checkConstraints(final EvolutionState state,
                                 final int tree,
                                 final GPIndividual typicalIndividual,
                                 final Parameter individualBase)
        {
        super.checkConstraints(state,tree,typicalIndividual,individualBase);
        if (children.length!=0)
            state.output.error("Incorrect number of children for node " + 
                               toStringForError() + " at " +
                               individualBase);
        }
</pre></tt>

<p>Note that there are no children.  Now what we'll do is define in our Problem two public doubles called <b>currentX</b> and <b>currentY</b>.  These are the values that these nodes return when evaluated.  Hence we add:

<tt><pre>
    public void eval(final EvolutionState state,
                     final int thread,
                     final GPData input,
                     final ADFStack stack,
                     final GPIndividual individual,
                     final Problem problem)
        {
        DoubleData rd = ((DoubleData)(input));
        rd.x = ((MultiValuedRegression)problem).currentX;
        }
    }
</pre></tt>

<p>The <b>Y</b> class is created similarly.  Make a file called "Y.java", and add to it:

<tt><pre>
package ec.app.tutorial4;
import ec.*;
import ec.gp.*;
import ec.util.*;

public class Y extends GPNode
    {
    public String toString() { return "y"; }

    public void checkConstraints(final EvolutionState state,
                                 final int tree,
                                 final GPIndividual typicalIndividual,
                                 final Parameter individualBase)
        {
        super.checkConstraints(state,tree,typicalIndividual,individualBase);
        if (children.length!=0)
            state.output.error("Incorrect number of children for node " + 
                               toStringForError() + " at " +
                               individualBase);
        }

    public void eval(final EvolutionState state,
                     final int thread,
                     final GPData input,
                     final ADFStack stack,
                     final GPIndividual individual,
                     final Problem problem)
        {
        DoubleData rd = ((DoubleData)(input));
        rd.x = ((MultiValuedRegression)problem).currentY;
        }
    }
</pre></tt>

<h3>Define the Problem</h3>

We don't need to define a GPIndividual or a GPTree -- the default forms for them are usually fine.  So all that's left for us is to define the Problem.  To keep things simple for this tutorial, we will do certain things.  First, we will hard-code to 10 the number of &lt;X,Y,f(X,Y)&gt; presentations given to the GPindividual.  Second, we rather than pre-generating the &lt;X,Y,f(X,Y)&gt; data elements, we will just generate a random one each time we need to provide a new presentation.  They will be generated at random from the function x*x*y + x*y + y.  Third, we will ignore floating point rounding errors which might make achieving a perfect 0.0 fitness difficult.  Fourth, our randomly-generated elements will range from 0.0 to 1.0.  Fifth, we will assume that nailing an answer within 0.01 counts as one hit.

<p>Create a file called "MultiValuedRegression.java".  In it add the following:

<tt><pre>
package ec.app.tutorial4;
import ec.util.*;
import ec.*;
import ec.gp.*;
import ec.gp.koza.*;
import ec.simple.*;

public class MultiValuedRegression extends GPProblem implements SimpleProblemForm
    {
    public static final String P_DATA = "data";

    public double currentX;
	public double currentY;
    
    public DoubleData input;

    public Object clone()
        {
        MultiValuedRegression newobj = (MultiValuedRegression) (super.clone());
        newobj.input = (DoubleData)(input.clone());
        return newobj;
        }
</pre></tt>

<p>Here, after three tutorials of discussion, we're finally implementing the <b>clone</b> method.  We override this method because to clone the MultiValuedRegression class, we must also clone the <b>input</b> variable (it's an object -- DoubleData, so it's not copied in a light clone which is the default for clone()).  Now we add the <b>setup</b> method.

<tt><pre>
    public void setup(final EvolutionState state,
                      final Parameter base)
        {
        <font color=gray>// very important, remember this</font>
        super.setup(state,base);

        <font color=gray>// set up our input -- don't want to use the default base, it's unsafe here</font>
        input = (DoubleData) state.parameters.getInstanceForParameterEq(
            base.push(P_DATA), null, DoubleData.class);
        input.setup(state,base.push(P_DATA));
        }
</pre></tt>

<p>Here we're basically using the <b>setup</b> method to load our DoubleData class.  We could have hard-coded the object to be a DoubleData, but that wouldn't be ECJ style.  Instead we load it from the parameter database.  This also allows the user to change the class in case that's useful to him.

<p>Last we need to define the <b>evaluate</b> method, which actually evaluates the individual and sets its fitness.  We will do so by testing the individual against ten data points, then setting its fitness to the sum of how close it got in each case.  Thus 0 is the ideal fitness -- in GP, 0 is the ideal and infinity is worse than the worst possible fitness.  The hit measure (an auxillary measure) is simply how often the system got "reasonably close".

<tt><pre>
    public void evaluate(final EvolutionState state, 
                         final Individual ind, 
                         final int subpopulation,
                         final int threadnum)
        {
        if (!ind.evaluated)  <font color=gray>// don't bother reevaluating</font>
                {
                int hits = 0;
                double sum = 0.0;
                double expectedResult;
                double result;
                for (int y=0;y&lt;10;y++)
                    {
                    currentX = state.random[threadnum].nextDouble();
                    currentY = state.random[threadnum].nextDouble();
                    expectedResult = currentX*currentX*currentY + currentX*currentY + currentY;
                    ((GPIndividual)ind).trees[0].child.eval(
                        state,threadnum,input,stack,((GPIndividual)ind),this);

                    result = Math.abs(expectedResult - input.x);
                    if (result &lt;= 0.01) hits++;
                    sum += result;                  
                    }

                <font color=gray>// the fitness better be KozaFitness!</font>
                KozaFitness f = ((KozaFitness)ind.fitness);
                f.setStandardizedFitness(state,(float)sum);
                f.hits = hits;
                ind.evaluated = true;
                }
            }
    }
</pre></tt>

<h3>Set up the Parameter File</h3>

<p>Strongly-typed, multi-tree GP has a <b>lot of parameters</b>.  Fortunately ECJ has written nearly all of them for you already, in the <b>ec/gp/koza/koza.params</b> file.  Take a minute and peruse through it, and also through the <b>ec/gp/gp.params</b> file which is its parent.  You'll see lots of clues there about what kinds of things you can do to bend ECJ's GP system to your will.  ECJ differs from Koza-I in very slight modifications of RAMPED-HALF-AND-HALF (ECJ uses lil-gp's approach), the use of 7-tournament selection, and a default population size of 1024.

<p>What we'll need to define in our own parameter file:  the function set, the Problem, and the GPData object.  Create a file called <b>tutorial4.params</b>, and in it add:

<tt><pre>
parent.0 = ../../gp/koza/koza.params

# the next four items are already defined in koza.params, but we
# put them here to be clear.

# We have one function set, of class GPFunctionSet

<p>The "nc0" and "nc2" are names for GPNodeConstraints objects defined in the koza.params file.  nc0 means a GPNodeConstraints object defining nodes with no children and <b>nil</b> as the return type.  nc2 means a GPNodeConstraints object defining nodes with two children (each with <b>nil</b>), plus <b>nil</b> as the return type.  Continuing, we add to the file information indicating our Problem and GPData choices:

<tt><pre>
eval.problem = ec.app.tutorial4.MultiValuedRegression
eval.problem.data = ec.app.tutorial4.DoubleData
</pre></tt>

<h3>Run the Problem</h3>

<p>Save the files and close them.  Compile the java files.  The run the problem with <b>java ec.Evolve -file tutorial4.params -p stat.gather-full=true</b> (because we'd like to see maximal information, and it's not that expensive to compute).

<p>On most Java VM's ECJ should discover the solution in four generations (it's an easy problem).  The out.stat file looks like this:

<p>Wow, only 34.14948 nodes fit in a KB!  That's 30 bytes per node!  Compare this to lil-gp, which uses 4 bytes per node, or 17 bytes for an Ephemeral Random Constant.  And DGPC uses only 1 byte per node.  These are packed array approaches, and compared to them, ECJ is a memory hog.  This is partially due to Java, and partially due to ECJ using a tree structure rather than a packed array structure. The upside is that ECJ's trees are <b>far</b> easier to modify and customize than packed arrays of simple numbers.

<p>Since GPNodes absolutely dominate the memory usage, we only bother looking at them.  Here's where the memory goes:

<ul>
<li> 8 bytes in the GPNode object header (on HotSpot anyway)
<li> 4 bytes to point to the parent
<li> 4 bytes to point to the child array
<li> 12 bytes in the array's header (on HotSpot)
<li> 4 bytes for the pointer from the parent's array to the object
<li> 1 byte for the argposition
<li> 1 byte for the constraints
</ul>

<p>If you've been counting, that totals to 34 bytes.  HotSpot is clever when dealing with zero-sized arrays, which I believe accounts for the slight lowering in usage.  PLUS: to evolve a population, ECJ must keep around the old population to breed into it.  That doubles your expected memory (GPSYS, another Java-based GP system, jumps through hoops to avoid this necessity).

<p>The net result of this is that GP runs which work fine in 8MB on lil-gp can require 64MB on ECJ.  This was a design decision tradeoff: I decided to run fast and to be highly flexible and powerful rather than be highly compact.  Besides...memory is cheap nowadays!  :-)

<h3>Print out the trees for LaTeX</h3>

Here's a nifty trick.  GPTrees can be printed out in LaTeX form rather than in s-expression form.  Run the system with the following command: <b>java ec.Evolve -file tutorial4.params -p gp.tree.latex=true</b> and the trees will be outputted in a form that can be stuck into a LaTeX file and printed.

<p>The best individual of the generation now looks like this:

<p><img src="tree.gif" valign=top align=right>Run latex on this file, and you'll get out a picture like the one shown at right.

<h3>Print out the trees in C-ish format</h3>

ECJ can print out trees in a somewhat C-style format, where nodes with exactly
two children are printed as if the node was an operator (+, *, etc.), and nodes with one child or three or greater children would be printed out in a function style a-la func(arg, arg, ...).  For example, 

<p><tt>(exp (- (sin (+ 4 (cos x))) (* x x)) x)</tt> 

<p>...would get instead printed as 

<p><tt>(sin(4 + cos(x)) - (x * x)) exp x</tt>

<p>We prefer a Lisp style, but this might be easier for you to read.  To do this, you can run the command like this:  <b>java ec.Evolve -file tutorial4.params -p gp.tree.c=true</b>

<h3>Print out the trees in Graphviz</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/">Graphviz</a> is a graph-layout language and renderer developed by AT&amp;T.  ECJ can generate trees that Graphviz renders quite nicely to PDF and other formats for inclusion in documents as well.  To do this, you can run the command like this:  <b>java ec.Evolve -file tutorial4.params -p gp.tree.graphviz=true</b>

<h3>Try some Elitism</h3>

Let's add two more gizmos.  First, we'll make the model elitist, which in this case wil be keeping the two best individuals in the subpopulation 0 of the population (you can specify different elitism values for each subpopulation).  Second, we'll change the statistics from the default <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/koza/KozaStatistics.html">KozaStatistics</a> to the line-by-line data format of <a href="../../classdocs/ec/gp/koza/KozaShortStatistics.html">KozaShortStatistics</a>.  We can change both on the command line.  <a href="../../classdocs/ec/simple/SimpleBreeder.html">SimpleBreeder</a> has an elitist feature.  Run the system as <b>java ec.Evolve -file tutorial4.params -p breed.elite.0=2 -p stat=ec.gp.koza.KozaShortStatistics -p stat.gather-full=true</b>

<p>The results are very similar in this case.  Here's the statistics file:
