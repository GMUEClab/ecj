Version		Change Log
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1		Initial version

2		First prerelease, too many additions to mention

3		Second prerelease
		Race condition bug fixed in ec.gp.koza.Crossover
	     	Breeding trees can now be prespecified
		Crossover can throw away the second sibling
		Multiplexer sped up by a factor of 10!  I might do the
			same thing for Parity and Regression if I have time,
			though for Regression it won't make much of a 
			difference -- thanks to Poli and Langdon
		Lots of little additions and tweaks
		GPNode functions increased
		Regression's * operator no longer shortcuts (due to NaN/Inf)
		Documentation fixes
		Fitness.equivalentTo() now is ==, not >=
		ec.util.Version modified slightly
		Individuals can now be written out to streams, not just logs

4		Third prerelease
		Finisher and Exchanger now are told the run result 
			(success/failure) when they're cleaning up
		Protected Log (rlog) in ec.app.regression.func.Log now is:
				(if (= x 0) x (abs (log x)))
			It was incorrectly:
				(if (<= x 0) x (abs (log x)))
		Edge domain added, with basic function classes
		GPNode.readNode() and ERC.readNode() now check to 
			make sure that the character after the read node is 
			whitespace, (, ), or end of string
		GPTree's readTree() method now checks if a line is empty, 
			rather than bombing.  :-)
		Default population size is now 1024
		Koza FULL/GROW/HALF algorithms now ramp properly; before 
			they were fixed to maxDepth rather than ramping 
			between minDepth and maxDepth.
		ECJ now uses the following for its FULL/GROW/HALF algorithm
			parameter defaults:
				GROW:  	min-depth=5, max-depth=5 (Koza standard
					for mutation)
				FULL:	undefined
				HALF:	min-depth=2, max-depth=6 (Koza standard
					for new individuals)
			Unlike Koza, ECJ permits single-terminal trees/subtrees
		Fixed the documentation for FULL/GROW/HALF to describe the
			odd things that Koza and lil-gp do.
		MersenneTwister and MersenneTwisterFast implement the new, 
			official, improved Mersenne Twister seeding algorithm.
		MersenneFastest.c file deleted
		Three Classes Shortened to the 31 char Mac filename limit:
			ParameterClassNotFoundException ->
				ParameterClassLoadException
			FitnessProportionateSelection ->
				FitProportionateSelection
			SteadyStateBreedingSourceForm ->
				SteadyStateBSourceForm
		ec/params and ec/simple/params files now don't have overlapping
			stuff
		ec/gp/params no longer includes ec/multiobjective/params
		ec.gp.koza.KozaShortStatistics now splits up
			postEvaluationStatistics so that you can include
			stuff in an overriding class before a println 
			is issued.
		
5		Fourth prerelease
		Decided on a strategy to deal with (ARGH!!!) Sun's shift to
			incompatible floating point types across platforms.
			See the file "ABOUT.JDK13"
		ec.select.TournamentSelection can have a tournament of 1
		added README.MacOS
		minor fix to ec.util.ParameterDatabase
		removed the (commented out) populate(...) method from ec.Group
		ec.Evolve now allows <=0 as a seed (since we're using the new
			MersenneTwister seeding algorithm).
		minor fix to ec.gp.GPTreeConstraints
		Added the TwoBox problem
		Orphaned interface GPNodeBuilderHelper deleted
		Modified documentation eval.finish -> eval.problem parameter
		Added the PTC1 and PTC2 algorithms.  Slight addition to
			GPNodeConstraints to accommodate them.
		Added the es package, including (mu,lambda) and (mu+lambda)
			selection strategies.  Totally untested, use at
			your own risk.
		Modified ECJ's strong-typing claim.  ECJ does atomic and
			set-based typing, but will not handle polymorphic
			algorithms without some coding (which I may or
			may not get to -- set-based strong typing is
			pretty dang useful, and it's rare that you
			need more than that).
		Tweaked documentation of SteadyState stuff; as currently
			implemented, the steady state evolution only marks
			one individual per subpop for death each loop
			(not n individuals, as had previously suggested).
		Added elitism to ec.simple.SimpleBreeder
		Symbolic Regression training set size now a parameter
		Fixed ForceBreedingPipeline's claimed default parameter base
		Changed default parameter base for entire ec.breed package
			to "breed"
		Moved all params files to foo.params.  Updated parent 
			statements within params files to reflect this.
			Hope I got 'em all.
		ec.BreedingSource now has typicalIndsProduced() set to a
			default of 1, rather than forcing it to be abstract.
		MAJOR CHANGE: Species no longer has an array of breeding 
			pipelines. It now has a single pipeline.  If you 
			need to pick from among pipelines, use 
			ec.breed.MultiBreedingPipeline.  The various GP 
			params files have been updated to reflect this 
			(since Koza GP by default picks from among pipelines),
			but your params files may be broken because stuff like
				pop.subpop.0.species.pipe.0.blah.blah
			has now changed to
				pop.subpop.0.species.pipe.source.0.blah.blah
			with the insertion of the MultiBreedingPipeline.  
			This is a good thing overall though -- it 
			dramatically simplifies the breeding code with no net
			loss.
		Tweaked the documentation stating the purpose of 
			GPBreedingPipeline.
		Tweaked documentation for ec.Evolve
		Modified ec.util.ParameterDatabase to sort its listed parameters
		Fixed bugs (I hope) in ec.gp.breed.RandomBranch
		Modified RandomChoice (adding the exemptZeroes method) so that 
			it properly handles zero-probability values, and also
			added the ability to handle objects which return 
			doubles rather than floats (RandomChoiceChooserD).
		ec.gp.GPNodeBuilder.canPick() and ec.gp.GPNodeBuilder.pickSize()
			are no longer final
		ec.util.MersenneTwister[Fast].nextBoolean([float|double]) now
			checks to see if the probability is 0.0 or 1.0 and
			guarantees to return false or true in that case
        	Modified ec.Exchanger.runComplete(...) to return a String
        	Modified the various EvolutionState subclasses to consider
        	    ec.Exchanger.runComplete(...) properly in their decision
        	    to shut down prematurely
		ec.steadystate.SteadyStateEvolutionState now reports that it
		    found an ideal individual
		Docs updated

6	Fifth prerelease
	Island models, coevolution, and competitive fitness have been added.
		A bunch of big modifications were made in order to implement 
       	     	coevolution, competitive fitness, and island models.  Get
            	ready, here we go:
        Major change, not backward-compatible:  the thread parameter
		    has been removed from most print- and read- methods 
		    which operate on PrintWriters or LineNumberReaders for
		    individuals and subcomponents.  This is because reading
		    and writing might be done in a private thread (for 
		    asynchronous island model exchanges for example), and so
 		    no thread number is appropriate.  If you need to use a
		    random number generator,  you will need to create one
		    yourself.  Do not rely on random[0].  Affected methods:

			Species.newIndividual(...)
			Fitness.printFitness(...)
			Fitness.readFitness(...)
			Individual.printIndividual(...)
			Individual.readindividual(...)
			simple.SimpleFitness.printFitness(...)
			simple.SimpleFitness.readFitness(...)
			gp.GPSpecies.newIndividual(...)
			gp.GPIndividual.printIndividual(...)
			gp.GPIndividual.readIndividual(...)
			gp.GPTree.printTree(...)
			gp.GPTree.readTree(...)
			gp.GPNode.printRootedTree(...)
			gp.GPNode.readRootedTree(...)
			gp.GPNode.printNode(...)
			gp.koza.KozaFitness.printFitness(...)
			gp.kozalKozaFitness.readFitness(...)
			multiobjective.MultiObjectiveFitness.printFitness(...)
			multiobjective.MultiObjectiveFitness.readFitness(...)
        
        Bug fix in ParameterDatabase.getStringWithDefault() now always
            returns the default string if the string was not found for
            the given parameter (sometimes it was returning null)
        gp.GPTree.printTree* methods now make certain that a return is
            printed at the end.  Also gp.GPIndividual.printIndividual*
            does not make certain (it assumes that printTree will 
            do it). Fixed to make IslandModel exchanges work right.
        EvolutionState.resetFromCheckpoint() is no longer a hook -- 
            now it's the official mechanism that Checkpoint uses
            to get the whole evolution system to restart itself
            after a checkpoint.  Accordingly, output.restart() and
            Exchanger.reinitializeContacts() have been moved to this
            location, and removed from their previous locations in
            the various EvolutionState objects.
        EvolutionState.go() and EvolutionState.run() no longer throw
            IOExceptions, because they no longer call output.restart()
        Fixed checkpoint bug -- GPNodeConstraints wasn't writing out all
            of its static variables.
        Fixed another checkpoint bug -- various Clique objects weren't
            getting written out at all because we no longer reference
            them with pointers but instead with bytes.  This was fixed
            by sticking their static hashtables in a vector called
            "statics" maintained by EvolutionState, so *something*
            serializable is pointing to them.
        Major change, not backward-compatable: the mechanism behind
            the Problem class has been modified, in order to clean up
            stuff to make competitive fitness and coevolution methods more
            doable.  To whit:
                1. Problem is no longer an interface.  It is now an
                empty abstract class.  We may add stuff to this class in
                the future.
                2. Problem's methods have been moved into another
                interface, "SimpleProblemForm".  Problems will now have
                Problem Forms which they implement.  This permits us to
                have different kinds of evaluation methods (for single
                evolution, coevolution, etc.)  The Evaluator involved
                is responsible for checking to make certain that the
                correct Problem Form is being used.
                3. The evaluate(...) and describe(...) methods no longer
                pass in an array of individuals; instead they pass in a
                single individual.
                
            The net result of this is that you will have to modify your
                Problem subclasses so that they implement
                ec.simple.SimpleProblemForm, and so that they do not go
                through the individuals passed in one by one and evaluate
                them, but rather just evaluate a single individual.  This
                generally means you just remove an outer for-loop (at
                least that's what I had to do for all the demo examples).
                
            Affected classes (besides your own Problem subclasses):
                SimpleProblemForm (new)
                Problem
                GPProblem
                SimpleEvaluator
                SteadyStateEvaluator
                Ant
                Edge
                Lawnmower
                Multiplexer
                multiplexerslow.Multiplexer
                Parity
                Regression
                TwoBox
	
	And now for stuff that doesn't have to do with Island Models or
	Coevolution or Competitive Fitness:

	MersenneTwister and MersenneTwisterFast now have a new nextLong(long)
		method so you can get longs up to a certain size.  It's not
		nearly as efficient as the nextInt method, as you might guess.
	ParameterDatabase now has the methods getLongWithMax and 
		getLongWithDefault.  One set of getLong(...) methods has been
		deprecated.  This gets getLong...(...) in-line with the getInt
		methods.
	A new package, vector, has been added for simple GA individuals.
		This package may be modified heavily, don't rely on it to be
		forward-compatible with future versions.
	A new package, rule, has been added for simple rule-based individuals.
		This package may be modified heavily, don't rely on it to be
		forward-compatible with future versions.
	Individuals now have a size() method, which provides a hook for
		parsimony pressure techniques.
	The ParameterDatabase itself has a new global parameter,
		print-params,
		which if true will print parameters as they are grabbed
		from the database through the various get() methods.
		Printing is done through stderr, not logged.
	ec.Evolve has been updated to provide new parameters which list
		all the parameters NOT used or NOT accessed (so you
		can see if you misspelled something and it's being ignored,
		for example).
        Fitness has been tweaked a little bit to allow the fitness() function
                to return ANY value between 0.0 and infinity, rather than the
                previous form (between 0.0 and 1.0).  This isn't a problem
                for fitness-proportionate selection methods because they use
                the distribution mechanisms, which autonormalize.  However,
                it necessitates changing SimpleFitness so that you now have
                to *specify* whether or not something is the ideal fitness.
                This may require a tiny rewrite in those apps which use
                SimpleFitness.  KozaFitness isn't affected because it's defined
                to have the ideal at 0.0.  MultiObjectiveFitness still defines
                its fitnesses as arrays from 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive -- if you
                need them to go to infinity as well, let us know.
        KozaFitness has deprecated its setFitness() function -- now you should
                instead use the better-named setStandardizedFitness().
        Some changes in how breeding pipelines operate:
                1. if generateMax is true, then MultiBreedingPipeline will 
		   return *exactly* the maximum typical number.  Previously
		   the pipeline returned a value between the maximum typical 
		   number and the maximum requested.
                2.  The typicalIndsProduced() method has been modified in all
		    the breeding pipelines.  Instead of returning 1 (for 
		    mutation) or 1 or 2 (for crossover), it now operates as
		    follows:
                        A. Mutation and Reproduction pipelines return the 
			   typical number of individuals returned by their 
		   	   sources.  Thus they no longer force their sources 
			   to return 1 individual apiece.
                        B. Crossover pipelines return the minimum typical number
                           of individuals returned by their sources.   Thus they
                           no longer force their sources to return 1 or 2 
			   individuals.
                    This change was made to make it easier to tack a mutation 
		    pipeline onto a crossover pipeline without losing 
		    individuals.
		3. Buffered and Force Breeding pipelines still work as normal
		Hope this doesn't break anything! Most of this will not make 
	        any difference, because selection methods typically return 1
		individual apiece anyway, which gets bubbled up through the 
		pipelines.  
	Added the Uniform and RandTree tree-generation algorithms.
	A Makefile is now provided.
	Added the app/ecsuite and app/sum examples for the Vector package

7 	Sixth prerelease
	Added SimpleShortStatistics	
	Modified Statistics to be a Clique, so you can have multiple statistics
		in tree arrangement.  If you have subclassed SimpleStatistics,
		you may want to modify your code to subclass from Statistics
		instead.
	Converted KozaStatistics to be a subclass of Statistics, not 
		SimpleStatistics
        Converted KozaShortStatistics to be a subclass of Statistics, not 
		SimpleStatistics
	Fixed a serious bug in the IslandExchange which causes it to not 
		connect to the correct topology.  
	Changed "nr-dest" to "num-dest" in InterPopulationExchange.
	Removed the "id" parameter in InterPopulationExchange (wasn't being 
		used).
	Updated and fixed the documentation for IslandExchange and 
		InterPopulationExchange.
	Added ABOUT.MacOSX
	Added a textual version of the license in LICENSE

8	Seventh prerelease
        All Individuals now must have a method called deepClone(), which 
                guarantees a deep clone of the individual.  This is done
                by default by doing a protoCloneSimple(), though if protoClone
                normally light-clones, deepClone() should be overridden.  This
                is done already in GPIndividual, and GPTree now sports a
                deepClone() method as well.  ec.gp.koza.ReproductionPipeline
                has been retrofitted to use deepClone(), just for the heck
                of it.  Best-of-generation now uses deep cloning to hang onto
                its individual and guarantee that its fitness doesn't change.
                Affected classes:
                    Individual, GPIndividual, GPTree, SimpleStatistics,
                    SimpleShortStatistics, KozaStatistics, KozaShortStatistics
        Removed best_of_generation from SimpleShortStatistics and
                KozaShortStatistics.  best_of_generation has long been
                supplanted by best_of_generation_a, and was dead code.
	Modified the island model parameter file examples so that they provide
		different initial seeds to different islands -- oops!
	Fixed CHANGES to be 80 columns
	ECJ now prints out seed and thread information
	Modified the island model parameter file examples so that they use
		8999 as the server port and 9000 and up for the client ports;
		each client island parameter file now specifies a unique client
		port, it was too much of a hassle having to specify the port
		on the command line every time to just test the system on a
		single machine.
	ecsuite no longer uses a ForceBreedingPipeline -- this is unneccessary
		because recent changes in Mutation pipelines has them returning
		all the individuals they receive from children rather than just
		1 (we were using a ForceBreedingPipeline to force the Mutation
		pipeline to return 2 kids, which it does anyway now)
	Modified ABOUT.MacOSX to add the trick where if you do -Xincgc you get
		much faster evolution runs
        Methods previously using ec.gp.koza.KozaFitness.setFitness() now instead
                call ec.gp.koza.KozaFitness.setStandardizedFitness() (the first
                method has been deprecated).  Accordingly, the sample domains
		now use setStandardizedFitness().
        Removed the numbits package
        BreedingSource had its produce(...) method incorrectly stated as having
            final int max, final int min.... instead of the other way around.
            No methods actually implementing or using BreedingSource did it this
            way however (it was a typo), so it's been fixed to be min first,
            then max.
	ParameterDatabase can now print out parameters as they're requested.
            Simply say:		-p print-params=true
	Fixed some bugs in the es package which were causing it to crash.
	    Also, es now uses es.mu.N to specify the mu value for subpopulation
	    N.  Additionally, the es.params file has been modified to make it
	    cleaner and easier to follow.
        Modified ABOUT.MacOSX to note that Apple has fixed the hostname bug
            in OS X 10.1
        Added VectorGene and GeneVectorIndividual to the vector package.
        Fixed bugs in the FloatVectorIndividual and DoubleVectorIndividual
            (they were being cast to IntegerVectorIndividual, which would
            cause a crash during equals(...)).
        Deleted RuleSetConstraint.java
        In GPNode's comments, oldSubtree and newSubtree were accidentally
            reversed.  That has been remedied.
        Modified TournamentSelection so that you can now specify a tournament
            "size" between 1.0 and 2.0 (floating-point), which results in a
            tournament of size 2 where the "better" individual wins with a
            probability of size/2.  Accordingly, TournamentSelection no longer
            permits a default size -- you *must* specify one.
        Added a ReproductionPipeline to ec.breed.  This pipeline relies on the
            new Individual.deepClone()... method.  Consequently, other
            ReproductionPipeline classes have been deprecated.
        Changes were made to better support steady state evolution:
            1. BreedingPipelines now support SteadyStateBSourceForm
            2. Major rewrite of SteadyStateEvolutionState, SteadyStateBreeder,
               and SteadyStateEvaluator to handle statistics better.
            3. Added an optional SteadyStateStatisticsForm
	    4. Added a new Statistics object: KozaSteadyStateStatistics
        A bug was fixed in SteadyStateEvaluator: it doesn't count the first
            population's individuals in the generation count.  This is remedied
            by updating the generation count by the generation size after the
            first evaluation.
        Modifications were made to the documentation of Statistics indicating 
            that when and if Statistics hooks are called is entirely up to the
            EvolutionState object, so you should make sure your Statistics 
            object is compatible with it.
        Slight modification to FitProportionateSelection documentation.
        BufferedBreedingPipeline, ForceBreedingPipeline, and 
            MultiBreedingPipeline weren't necessarily cloning their individuals.
            Now they are more careful!
        GenerationSwitchPipeline added.  This pipeline switches children at some
            generation.  Useful for some adaptive mechanisms.
        Added Tutorial 1
        Fixed an inifinite-loop bug in BufferedBreedingPipeline
        Fixed some equality bugs in IslandExchange noted by jlint
        Fixed a minor output verbosity bug noted by jlint
        Little syntactic tweaks (no bug fixes) to make jlint happier
        jlint makes numerous other complaints, but I've verified that they're
            not significant.  To whit:
            1. complaints about null references are due to jlint not 
               understanding that state.output.fatal() and 
               state.output.exitWithErrors() will exit the program.
            2. array index out-of-bounds complaints are because I will subtract
               1 from a value to get the array index sometimes; that's just 
               fine.
            3. complaints about "volatile" access are because multiple threads 
               in ECJ make simultaneous access to read-only protocol areas of
               the program, which is fine.
            4. synchronized complaints are specious
            5. Complaints about Mersenne Twister bugs are all false -- I've
               double checked.  It looks like an error in jlint's understanding
               of how >> works.  BTW, it also complains about java.util.Random
               in the same way. :-)
        Minor efficiency change: CrossoverPipeline (line 325) used to avoid
               verifying points only when the second parent was tossed; now we
               also do it if there's only one individual to create.  Should have
               no change at all on the system.
        CrossoverPipeline.parents made public, CrossoverPipeline.verifyPoints
               moved from private to public final
	Added Koza Quintic and Sextic problems to Regression
        Fixes to elitism code -- SimpleBreeder wasn't preserving all the elites,
               and also wasn't deep-cloning them.  Thanks to garij8l0@elon.edu
        RuleSetConstraints and RuleConstraints serialize properly, oops
	Made a few static constants final that we had not noticed.
        Fixed reset bug in GeneVectorIndividual.
	(Finally) changed the nostore parameter to store (and flipped the
               meaning)
        Individuals now contain a pointer to their species.  readIndividual(...)
               should not try to "read" in the species, nor should
               printIndividual(...) attempt to "print" the species to the
               stream.  Species should be careful to set the prototypical 
               individual's species to themselves BEFORE calling setup(...) on
               the prototypical individual.
        MAJOR OVERHAUL OF VECTOR PACKAGE.  Sorry, it had to be done.
               VectorIndividuals previously were carrying around lots of baggage
               (like genome size, mutation probabilities, crossover types, etc.)
               that should be shared among individuals.  So now they store this
               information in their shared VectorSpecies.  Accordingly, there 
               are different VectorSpecies subclasses for different data type 
               groups.  An individual can access this data now because 
               Individuals have pointers to their species (see above) now.
        VectorIndividuals can now have a min/max constraint on their genes OR
               individual unique min/max constraints on each separate gene. 
        Deleted old MacOSX 10.0.x stuff from About.MacOSX
	GroupedProblem changed to an Interface called GroupedProblemForm
	Removed ec.gp.koza.ReproductionPipeline and
		ec.rule.breed.RuleReproductionPipeline and
		ec.vector.breed.VectorReproductionPipeline since they 
		all duplicate ec.breed.ReproductionPipeline
	simple.params now states that the default fitness for subpop 0 is
		ec.simple.SimpleFitness
	ec.params now has duplicate-retries set to 0
	when seeds=time, ec.Evolve makes sure the seeds are all different from
		each other.
	Added tutorial 2
	Fixed small bug in CompetitiveEvaluator (sometimes the number of games
		for individuals in two-way random tournaments were mixed).
		Thanks to Flavio Baronti <f.baro@libero.it> for alerting us.
	Fixed a bug in the Statistics files that altered the best_of_run
		individual being properly calculated in the multiple
		population cases. Thanks to Krzysztof (Chris) Krawiec for
		alerting us.
	Added the parsimony package. This package contains various simple
		parsimony pressure techniques we've been using.
	Added the teambots package.

9	Eighth Prerelease
	Well, it looks like ECJ usage is really taking off, given the rate
		of bug reports.  :-)
	Fixed a bug in IntegerVectorSpecies and FloatVectorSpecies that did
		not properly set the min and max gene values on a per-gene
		basis. Thanks to Emanuel Slaby <Emanuel.Slaby@unibw-hamburg.de>
	Fixed a minor bug in ec.util.Output that might cause it to try to
		get the value of the announcements vector even if the vector
		is null.  Thanks to Mohamad Mehdi Haji <m2haji@yahoo.com>
	Added the ability to specify an integer Parameter value in hex
	Bug fix in PTC2, not using the right distributions when doing strong
		typing.  Doesn't affect typeless runs.  Thanks to David
		Chan <dmchan@stanford.edu>
	KozaStatistcs now does printIndividualForHumans rather than
		printIndividual -- not sure when it had reverted there.
	SteadyStateBreeder had a serious bug that prevented individuals from
		getting evaluated -- this resulted in statistics that didn't
		converge (They stayed perfectly flat), so it was pretty
		obvious.  Nailed down thanks to a mention of oddities from
		Atif Azad <atif.azad@ul.ie>
	SteadyStateBreeder now lets the deselector know that an individual has
		been replaced.
	The IslandExchange server now announces that it's shutting down -- it
		only does so if all the clients have disconnected.
	Vector package includes evaluated: line in its readers and writers
	Tutorials 3 and 4 added
	Minor print bug removed form DoubleIndividual and FloatIndividual
	Small bugs fixed in island model
	SPEA2 package added (thanks to Robert Hubley!)

10	Ninth Prerelease :-)
	Mersenne Twister code updated to new initialization algorithm.  This
		will result in replicability incompatibility with versions
		9 and below.  I keep the old versions of MersenneTwister
		as gzipped files in the ec/util/ directory in case you'd
		want to use them.
	Small makefile and documentation mods
	ec.coevolve.CompetitiveEvaluator#EncapsulatedIndividual moved out to
		its own scope to make older java systems happy.  Should have no
		effect otherwise.
	ECJ now signals an error if the seed is bad
	Added gzipped capabilities to logs.  Gzipped output streams are heavily
		buffered (argh) and Java doesn't necessarily call finalize() on
		them so they will not write out.  So we had to add a new close()
		method to the Output class which Evolve() calls and gets it to
		flush and close its logs prior to shutting down.  The gzipped
		classes will STILL not properly write out if the user breaks the
		program prematurely.
	Improvements to rule code (preprocesing, post processing, etc.)
	Removed a column from SimpleShortStatistics' printing, and fixed its
		statements of what gets printed in the documentation
	Fixed BAD bug in evolution strategies package: populations were being
		sorted in the wrong direction, so the mu parents were actually
		the *worst* of the population, not the best.  Also, we now
		deep-clone the individuals for mu+lambda, not just copy them,
		just to be safe.
	Individual.toString() now prints out its hash code (which is not
		unique for Individuals) after its unique identity hash
		code (which IS unique for all objects).  That way two
		individuals never print the same even if they have the same
		internals.
	GeneVectorIndividual didn't set up its genome properly (left the genes
		as null).  Minor mods to GeneVectorindividual and to
		GeneVectorSpecies to handle this correctly.
	Slight modification to MersenneTwister and MersenneTwisterFast: changed
		the default constructors so that they randomized based on the
		system time rather than on an arbitrary constant seed (4357).
		This should have no effect on ECJ as it never uses the default
		constructor -- however if you use the default constructor for
		your own purposes, things will now be different.  This change
		was made to bring MT in line with java.util.Random's behavior.

11 Tenth Prerelease.  Maybe we should start calling these "Releases"!  :-)

	Slight tweak to the tutorials to fix an HTML bug in /tt
	Fixed bug in gp/build/MutateOneNodePipeline, which didn't handle
		mutation of an already-copied individual properly.  Along the
		way, added a new method to GPNode: replaceWith(GPNode), which
		replaces it in its tree with some other node.  Thanks to
		David Cooper dcooper@atl.lmco.com
	Small error in parity documentation.  Thanks to Howard Landman
		howard@riverrock.org
	finishProducing(...) had not been implemented but never called in
		SelectionMethod  -- it was vestigial.  But because we found it
		useful for coevolution stuff, it's now properly called by all
		the places I know of which also call prepareToProduce(), namely
		MuCommaLambdaBreeder, SimpleBreeder, IslandExchange, 
		InterPopulationExchange, and SteadyStateBreeder.  The latter	
		required a new function to be implemented called finishPipelines
		(called only on SteadyStateBreeder).  All this should have no
		effect at all on preexisting stuff.
	Received permission to change, then promptly changed, the license to
		MersenneTwister.  It was originally under LGPL, and FSF won't
		give a straight answer as to whether or not LGPL is valid
		for Java or if in fact it just reverts to GPL due to some
		errors in the LGPL.  It looks like LGPL is broken with
		respect to Java, and so to prevent ECJ from going all under
		GPL, I've changed MersenneTwister's license to Artistic
		with permission of the original [early] author.
	Slightly tweaked MersenneTwister and MersenneTwisterFast, copying
		certain variables to locals, which should result in very
		slightly faster MT code (maybe 5%)
	MultiobjectiveFitness had slight change in printFitnessForHumans
		(a println instead of a print)
	RandomChoiceChooser now has additional organizeDistribution functions
		which allow distributions to be all zeros (if so, it's
		assumed to choose from among the elements uniformly).  
		The default functions still throw exceptions if this 
		is the case.  Also RandomChoiceChooser now throws an 
		exception if the distribution is empty.
	IMPORTANT CHANGE, may not be backward-compatible.  Fitness has
		been revised to now allow the fitness() function to return
		negative values.  Any finite value is now permitted.
		Selection methods based on proportionate selection, which
		previously could safely assume that fitnesses were zero or
		positive, may no longer be able to do so.  You must check
		to see if fitnesses are negative in such selection
		methods.  BestSelection, FitProportionateSelection, and
		GreedyOverselection have been accordingly revised.
	IslandExchange and InterPopulationExchange now have a chattiness
		option to shut them up.
	SPEAMultiObjectiveFitness is now a subclass of
		MultiObjectiveFitness, and its methods have been cleaned
		up accordingly.  The primary effect here is the
		elimination of the default base.  We're now using
		MultiObjectiveFitness's default base, so watch out there.
	MultiObjectiveFitness now always returns false for isIdealFitness(),
		unless overridden in a subclass.  Accordingly the
		criterionIsAnd parameter is now gone.
	SPEATournamentSelection is now a subclass of TournamentSelection,
		and its methods have been unified accordingly.  The
		primary effect here is the elimination of the default base.
		We're now using TournamentSelection's default base, so
		watch out there.
	Addition of spea2.params
	multiobjective.params updated to corrected parameters
	bug fix to inter.params
	BreedingSource.setupProbabilities now allows all of the children
		to have zero probabilities.  POSSIBLY NOT Backward 
		compatible -- double-check your code to make sure that
		if you call this function (unlikely) that this fact
		is acceptable (it almost certainly should be). 
	Accordingly, MultiBreedingPipeline now allows all of its children
		to have zero probabilities, but issues a warning just in case.
	Removed ABOUT.MacOSX file: nothing in it interesting any longer
	Documentation fix to RuleSpecies' default base
	Fixed bugs in the parameters returned in the fatal errors of
		IntegerVectorSpecies.setup and FloatVectorSpecies.setup
	Various vector species now properly look up default parameters
	InterPopulationExchange's selection methods are set up with the
		proper parameters.
	InterPopulationExchange double-checks that incoming immigrants
		won't be more than the subpopulation size (which would
		cause an infinite loop in the selection-to-die procedure)
	Redesigned the coevolutionary evaluator for both single population
		competitive coevolution, and also for multiple population
		cooperative coevolution.  There's no need for incremental
		fitness anymore, but rather the Problem becomes more
		important for different ways of combining results from
		different interactions with other individuals into a unique
		fitness.
	Added  app/coevolve1 and app/coevolve2 to illustrate simple
	       competitive and cooperative coevolutionary settings.
	Reformatted

12 Eleventh er, prerelease

        Fixed some bugs in the Makefile indent feature
	Fixed a documentation bug in MersenneTwisterFast that suggested that
       	       nextDouble() returned a number in [0,1].  It does not.  
               It's [0,1), just like java.util.Random.
        Added DecompressingInputStream and CompressingOutputStream in 
               preparation for compressing the stream sockets of the 
               island model etc.
        ParameterDatabase.getString(Param) now public.  Dunno why not.
        ParameterDatabase.list... methods all now flush
        Version no longer has a "suggested minimum Java" field.  Instead
               there's just the "minimum java" field.  This field has now
               been bumped up from 1.1 to 1.2.
        ParameterDatabase uses Java's Collections.sort(...) routines rather
               than QuickSort.  We can do this because the minimum java is now
               1.2.  This allows ParameterDatabase to be used independently
               of ECJ (or more specifically, of QuickSort).
        ParameterDatabase.toString() defined for benefit of bsh.  The format
               is HASH : (PARENT1, PARENT2, ...)  where HASH is the
               .toString() value of the ParameterDatabase's hash table
               (typically it's of the form {key=val, key=val, ...} ), and each
               PARENT is the .toString() of the ParameterDatababase's
               parent parameter databases.
	Added "*.java" (top-level ec directory) to the Makefile
	Reformatting
	Other authors added to the header when ECJ is run
	Default format for Code.encode(true) is "T" and for false, "F".
		Code.decode(...) can still detect "true" and "false" if
		necessary.
	Code.decode() can detect floats and doubles in the form
		d|HUMAN_READABLE_FORMAT| and f|HUMAN_READABLE_FORMAT|
		in this case, the human readable format is used and the
		(missing) machine readable format is ignored.  This
		simplifies writing floats and doubles to be read in
		for reading populations from files.
	Print out message when loading subpopulations from files
	Rewrote the vector read/write code to consistently use Code.  This
		is much less readable, but it's consistent and easier to
		debug.  We had some ugly bugs in there.  Thanks to Ta Nguyen
		Binh Duong binhduong@pmail.ntu.edu.sg
	Rewrote Individual to eliminate the necessity to override some methods
		(namely, printIndividual (both versions), readIndividual, and
		printIndividualForHumans).  This was done by implementing a
		default version of each of these methods.  This in turn
		required implementing three new methods which have default
		versions and are NOT abstract, but which the user will
		likely want to override: genotypeToString, 
		genotypeToStringForHumans, and parseGenotype (which by
		default generates an error).
	Rewrote the vector classes to use the new Individual string methods
		described previously.  This necessitated deprecating some
		GeneVector methods and implementing new methods called
		printGeneToString and printGeneToStringForHumans.  Let's
		hope all this rewriting doesn't break something!

13 	Yet another prerelease!
        Tweaks to Makefile to make compiling with jikes more straightforward
        ec.EvolutionState is now allowed to use ec.Statistics as its
                (do-nothing) statistics class
        Slight bug in MersenneTwister: seeds were only allowed to be 28 bits.
                The mask was supposed to allow 32 bits.
	IslandExchange flushes the output streams just in case the Individuals
		didn't use println to write themselves to the PrintWriter.
	Added some warnings to the Compressing stream docs
	Individual.setup no longer abstract.  It's just a default
		implementation which does nothing.
	MAJOR CHANGE: Fitness is now an abstract class, not an interface.
		This done mostly to make it easier to create Fitness objects
		by providing sensible default methods, just as we had rewritten
		Individual to eliminate some methods.  If you have created
		a Fitness implementation, you'll need to change 'implements'
		to 'extends'.  Beyond that you shouldn't need to do anything,
		though you can get rid of your protoCloneSimple() function,
		your protoClone() function if it does nothing but call clone()
		(or otherwise call super.protoClone() to get the object now),
		and just for good measure, call super.setup() in your setup
		method (though Fitness.setup() actually does nothing).  Now
		you can delete your printFitness...() methods and replace
		them with fitnessToString() and fitnessToStringForHumans()
		implementations.
	Removed ABOUT.MacOS9, since the current minimum Java for ECJ is
		1.2, and OS 9 only supports 1.1.8.
	Modified Tutorial4 documentation so that it uses the (revised)
		breed.elites.0=... rather than breed.elites=...  Thanks to 
		Grant Morganryuugguu <grant@ryuuguu.com>
	Fixed bug in [Integer|Double|etc]VectorIndividual.split(...) which
		didn't put the elements in the proper location in the arrays,
		leading to a crash.
	IslandExchange clients now properly retry to connect after a sleep
	Added Master/Slave capability for distributed evaluation of individuals.
	Added compression to the communication streams between the StarProblem 
		master and slaves.  It's use is configurable via the 
		star.compression parameter.	
	Removed globals that otherwise prevent ECJ to be self contained.  The 
		motivation here is to permit multiple experiments to be run in
		the same JVM, either sequentially or concurrently, and to 
		allow experiments to be run in Java Applets.  The globals in 
		question are:
		
		ec.gp.GPFunctionSet.all
			-> ec.gp.GPInitializer.functionSetRepository
		ec.gp.GPType.all
			-> ec.gp.GPInitializer.typeRepository
		ec.gp.GPType.numAtomic
			-> ec.gp.GPInitializer.numAtomicTypes
		ec.gp.GPType.numSet
			-> ec.gp.GPInitializer.numSetTypes
		ec.gp.GPNodeConstraints.all
			-> ec.gp.GPInitializer.nodeConstraintRepository
		ec.gp.GPNodeConstraints.constraints
			-> ec.gp.GPInitializer.nodeConstraints
		ec.gp.GPNodeConstraints.numConstraints
			-> ec.gp.GPInitializer.numNodeConstraints
		ec.gp.GPTreeConstraints.all
			-> ec.gp.GPInitializer.treeConstraintRepository
		ec.gp.GPTreeConstraints.constraints
			-> ec.gp.GPInitializer.treeConstraints
		ec.gp.GPTreeConstraints.numConstraints
			-> ec.gp.GPInitializer.numTreeConstraints
		ec.rule.RuleConstraints.all
			-> ec.rule.RuleInitializer.ruleConstraintRepository
		ec.rule.RuleConstraints.constraints
			-> ec.rule.RuleInitializer.ruleConstraints
		ec.rule.RuleConstraints.numConstraints
			-> ec.rule.RuleInitializer.numRuleConstraints
		ec.rule.RuleSetConstraints.all
			-> ec.rule.RuleInitializer.ruleSetConstraintRepository
		ec.rule.RuleSetConstraints.constraints
			-> ec.rule.RuleInitializer.ruleSetConstraints
		ec.rule.RuleSetConstraints.numConstraints
			-> ec.rule.RuleInitializer.numRuleSetConstraints
		
		These variables were moved to either GPInitializer or
		RuleInitializer respectively and were made member variables
		instead of globals.  They are initialized during
		{GP|Rule}Initializer.setup(...) and are available via
		EvolutionState.initializer.  These globals were also given new
		names as specified above.
		
		Consequently, the following methods needed to be modified in
		order to accomodate the change.  They now accept an additional
		Initializer (either GP or Rule) parameter in order to get access
		to the relevant data: 

		ec.gp.GPAtomicType.compatibleWith()
		ec.gp.GPNode.constraints()
		ec.gp.GPNode.parentType()
		ec.gp.GPNode.swapCompatibleWith()
		ec.gp.GPSetType.compatibleWith()
		ec.gp.GPTree.constraints()
		ec.gp.GPType.compatibleWith()
		ec.gp.breed.MutateDemotePipeline.demotable()
		ec.gp.breed.MutateDemotePipeline.numDemotableNodes()
		ec.gp.breed.MutateDemotePipeline._numDemotableNodes()
		ec.gp.breed.MutateDemotePipeline.pickDemotableNode()
		ec.gp.breed.MutateDemotePipeline._pickDemotableNode()
		ec.gp.breed.MutatePromotePipeline.promotable()
		ec.gp.breed.MutatePromotePipeline.numPromotableNodes()
		ec.gp.breed.MutatePromotePipeline.pickPromotableNode()
		ec.gp.breed.MutateSwapPipeline.swappable()
		ec.gp.breed.MutateSwapPipeline.numSwappableNodes()
		ec.gp.breed.MutateSwapPipeline.pickSwappableNode()
		ec.gp.breed.InternalCrossoverPipeline.verifyPoints()
		ec.gp.breed.CrossoverPipeline.verifyPoints()
		ec.gp.build.Uniform.numTreesOfType()
		ec.gp.build.Uniform.numTreesRootedByNode()
		ec.gp.build.Uniform.numChildPermutations()
		ec.gp.build.Uniform.createTreeOfType()
		ec.gp.build.Uniform.fillNodeWithChildren()
		ec.rule.Rule.constraints()
		ec.rule.RuleSet.constraints()
		
	Added checkpointing of Slave random state.  When a checkpoint occurs,
		the StarProblemServer requests the current random state of each
		slave. The random state is then appended to the checkpoint file.
	Updated MersenneTwister to latest version (11), which is just
		documentation changes.  Thanks to Seth Sticco sethn@snsware.net
	Modifications to SimpleEvolutionState, mostly cleaning up stuff.  The
		go() method has been removed in preparation for a new more
		modular design which will be added in a bit.  Also, the
		generation counter has been moved to a different location
		in the loop, though the print-outs stay the same.  It will
		very slightly affect checkpointing as generation++ occurs
		BEFORE checkpointing now.
	Significant modifications to the Steady State package.  We have cleaned
		up the package to conform to the same layout as the
		SimpleEvolutionState package above; plus a number of clean-ups
		including the elimination of pseudoGeneration.  generation
		now actually means *generation* in some reason sense, and
		there's a new variable called evaluations.
	We've eliminated SteadyStateSpeciesForm and have moved its sole
		method, deselector(), into SteadyStateBreeder, which gathers
		deselectors directly using a new parameter in
		steadystate.params.
	Eliminated GPSteadyStateSpecies because SteadyStateSpeciesForm is gone
	Eliminated garbage collection parameters (gc, aggressive)
	Moved ESEvolutionState's various variables into MuCommaLambdaBreeder
		(where they should have gone in the first place).
	Deleted ESEvolutionState -- no longer needed
	Deleted ESBreederForm -- no longer needed
	added ec/app/sum/steadysum.params example
	Eliminated Evolve.make
	Tutorials updated to reflect new arrangement
	ProportionalTournament's default parameter base has been changed
		to proportional-tournament (from prob-tournament)
	Added documentation for DoubleTournament
	Changed all the parsimony class names to be more consistent with
		ECJ's naming scheme:

		DoubleTournament -> DoubleTournamentSelection
		ProportionalTournament -> ProportionalTournamentSelection
		BucketTournament -> BucketTournamentSelection
		RatioBucketTournament -> RatioBucketTournamentSelection
		LexicographicTournament -> LexicographicTournamentSelection

		These names are over 32 bytes long and so may cause problems
		for older operating systems (MacOS 9 for example).
	Added TarpeianStatistics
	Updated Version class
	Added one-time warnings
	Updated Evolve to add a new loop facility
	Eliminated GPSpeciesForm
	Added warts.html
	Minor bug fixes to Uniform.java
	Added types[] array to list all the GPTypes
	Modified GPTreeConstraints' error messages about typing to warnings
		about typing.
	Added binary read/write functionality to rule package
	Added binary read/write functionality to vector package
	Added binary read/write functionality to all fitness classes
	Updated binary read/write functionality for GP facility to write GPNodes
		using indexes into functionsets.
	Updated documentation on Clique explaining the new location of various
		Clique repositories
	Added about box to GUI
	Bug fixes to master/slave evaluator
	Added bulk-sends in SimpleEvolutionState for the master/slave evaluator
	Re-indented

14 	At this point, dare we call it a prerelease?
	Boolean.toString(boolean) is not available in Java 1.3.  Changed to
		("" + boolean) in ec.display.ControlPanel
	Likewise for all-caps colors
	Removed magic numbers in Slave
	Slave can now return fitnesses (as default) instead of individuals
	Slave doesn't generate a new Subpopulation each time an individual
		is evaluated (oops)
	Added Evolve.determineSeed
	EvolutionState now contains a randomSeedOffset variable, set by Evolve
		to help ec.eval.MasterProblem create seeds.
	Updated MersenneTwister and MersenneTwisterFast to version 12,
		including equals(...) methods.
	Deleted Evolve.main2
	In Evolve, as soon as the Output is set up, all future errors are
		fatal(...) or error(...) rather than initialError(...)
	Deleted unused Problem.setCheckpoint, restoreFromCheckpoint,
		resetFromCheckpoint
	Problem.shutdown renamed to Problem.closeContacts(state,result)
	Evaluator.closeContacts(state,result) added
	SteadyStateBreeder now checks for duplicate individuals.
	Uniform now resets its new nodes. This necessitated adding
		EvolutionState and thread to some functions as arguments.
		Thanks to Artur Matos amatos@create.human.nagoya-u.ac.jp
	Introduced GPNode.nodeEquivalentTo(...) which is looser than
		GPNode.nodeEquals(...) and attempts to determine if the two
		nodes came from the same prototype parent (or are otherwise
		compatible in that fashion).  GPNode.writeRootedTree(...)
		now uses nodeEquivalentTo(...) instead of nodeEquals(...)
		Thanks to Artur Matos amatos@create.human.nagoya-u.ac.jp
	Commented out print-used-params in coevolve2.params
	Updated docs for BestSelection (n wasn't explained).  Thanks to
		Robert Hovden Robert.M.Hovden@jpl.nasa.gov
	Added donated modifications to charting code.  Thanks to
		Robert Hovden Robert.M.Hovden@jpl.nasa.gov
	SimpleChartingStatistics.java has been deleted entirely
	Statistics is back to being a Singleton.  Sure, you can have more
		than one Statistics object; but Cliques generally require
		repositories and Statistics doesn't have one.  Maybe we
		should make Statistics just a Setup instead.
	SteadyStateStatisticsForm.nextPseudogenerationStatistics deleted
	SteadyStateBreeder's duplicate checking uses hash tables with
		incremented and decremented integers rather than doing
		an O(n) scan through the array.  Rather faster.
	steadystate.params has pick-worst set to true now, just in case
	SteadyStateBreeder now properly looks up the deselector, oops
	Additions to Statistics so it can be a SteadyStateStatisticsForm
	Updated KozaStatistics and SimpleStatistics to provide basic
		SteadyStateStatisticsForm implementations (at least
		to handle the best individual of population properly).
	Deleted KozaSteadyStateStatistics
	Updated steadysum.params
	Added steadynoerc.params to Regression example
	ParameterDatabase.getInt(parameter) now private
	ParameterDatabase.getLong(parameter) now private
	ParameterDatabase.getString(parameter) now private
	ParameterDatabase.getStringWithDefault(parameter) now private
	ParameterDatabase.uncheck() now private
	Modifications to various classes in display/ and display/chart
		and eval/ so they don't call the protected single-parameter
		ParameterDatabase functions.  Also, Evaluator.
	Modified ParameterDatabase's print-params function to be more
		expressive (prints existence tests, failed and
		unnecessary tests)
	All private and protected ParameterDatabase methods now
		package-level
	Documentation changes to ParameterDatabase
	Modified GPTreeConstraints.checkFunctionSetAvailablility to fix
		a type bug (root types were not being added to the list
		of types to check).
	Updated MersenneTwister and MersenneTwisterFast
        Minor bug in Code: \uxxxx was falling through in the switch
	MutationPipeline and MutateAllNodesPipeline were both incorrectly 
		setting individual.evaluated = true instead of = false
		when the source was another pipeline rather than a selection
		method.  This would result in individuals not being run
		again for fitness.  InternalCrossoverPipeline was doing the
		same, but in all cases.  These have been fixed.  Thanks
		to Stefan Wappler stefan.wappler@daimlerchrysler.com
	The SimpleEvaluator class has two new functions: prepareToEvaluate
		and finishEvaluating.  They are called before and after a
		bunch of individuals need to be evaluated.  The Master/Slave
		evaluation has been updated to take advantage of this setup.
	Fixed a small bug Evolve.java when determining the random seed for
		each thread.
	Made various methods non-private in the GUI
	Made certain final variables static
	Removed MersenneTwisterFastOLD.java.gz MersenneTwisterOLD.java.gz
	Updated ecj to new directory structure consistent with mason.  In
		this structure, the old ec directory is now a subdirectory
		of an outer ecj directory.  In the ecj directory goes the
		docs directory, READMEs, a new start directory (with some
		scripts to fire up ecj), the Makefile, etc.
	Added a start-up script for Windows
	Fixed minor bugs in CompetitiveEvaluator
	Removed some private declarations in the GUI
	Made the GUI capable of use in 1.3.1
	Reindented
	Fixed mutation bugs in vectors when maxGene is much larger than
		minGene (over the size of an integer or long)
	steadysum.params now does random deselection.  We've updated the
		instructions in the two app examples for steady state
		evolution accordingly.
	Updated SimpleFitness docs
        All minimization problems in ECSuite are now transformed into
                maximization problems by converting f(x) --> -f(x), instead
                of f(x) --> 1.0/(1.0+f(x)).  Also, the Booth and Griewangk
                problems are now supported.
	Slight modification to seed-setting in Evolve.java.  See the
		Evolve.java documentation for more information.  We've not
		updated the seed-setting in the GUI, so there may be a
		discontinuity, particularly if you're using both the command
		line and the GUI to do multiple-job runs.
	Modifications of Evolve.java to fix a few bugs in the main() and
		make it easier to use.  There is now an extensive discussion
		in the Evolve.java docs about how to make new main() loops.
	Modified MuCommaLambdaBreeder to (knock on wood) to properly compute
		the 1/5 rule.  This was broken when we merged the es package
		and got rid of ESEvolutionState.
	EvolutionState.statics has been officially deprecated.  Do not use it.
	Tweaked Tutorial4
	Updated the License
	Fixed a bug in ADFs that was tickled by typing.  We check to see if
		there exists exactly one ADFArgument node in an ADF's tree for
		each argument of the ADF.  But we check it using the nodes
		array in the GPFunctionSet, which can contain multiple copies
		of the same exact node, put into different subarrays by
		compatable type.  This was not taken into account, producing
		a spurious warning.  We now make certain that the additional
		ADFArgument we've discovered isn't the exact same node as the
		original one.  Thanks to Hauptman Ami amiha@cs.bgu.ac.il
	Documentation bugs in FloatVectorSpecies fixed.
	Added a simple C-style printing mechanism.  Thanks to Leonardo
		Vanneschi lvanneschi@yahoo.it for the idea.  Updated tutorial
		4 to reflect this.
	Added spatial package: spatially-embedded EAs 
	Added a new newIndividual(...) to Species
	Removed certain newIndividual(...) abstract methods from Species 
		(or more specifically, created default versions of them 
		which operate properly in most cases).  Set all current
		Species subclasses to use those default versions.
	Changed the island model facility to use the new DataInput/DataOutput
		reader and writer.
	Removed deprecated show() references
	Rule.readRuleFromString() by default now throws an error
	VectorGene.printGeneToString() and printGeneToStringForHumans() now
		by default both call toString().
	Added Rule.printRuleToString() and Rule.printRuleToStringForHumans()
	Undeprecated printGene(state,verbosity,log)
	GPNode.readNode/writeNode now by default throw errors
	Updated various prototypes' discussion of printing

15 	Now that's what I call a prerelease!
	See the file 'UPGRADING' for more detailed discussion.
	Reduced protoClone() to clone().  Some history: in the far past,
		there were different rules about clone() and I was worried
		about violating the clone() definition.  Hence protoClone()
		instead of clone().  Furthermore, there was a significant
		cost paid when wrapping code in a try { ... } (or so I had
		thought, memory is fuzzy now) way back in 1998, before
		HotSpot etc. changed how we do things now.  That cost
		is zero now, thus obviating the need for protoCloneSimple.
		So we have eliminated all the protoCloneSimple calls
		entirely, and rewritten all protoClone methods to just be
		clone methods which call super.clone wrapped in a try { }.
		This is dramatically simpler.  We've also eliminated all
		the Simple versions of various cloners in GPNode, and have
		cleaned out all the previous try { } wrappers various
		methods used to directly call protoClone rather than
		protoCloneSimple.  Additionally, MersenneTwister and
		MersenneTwisterFast have had their clone() methods
		upgraded to not throw CloneNotSupportedException, and
		Group has had its abstract emptyClone() method's
		CloneNotSupportedException removed.  We still use
		emptyClone because it's fundamentally different from the
		clone() contract.  Individual.deepClone() has also had
		CloneNotSupportedException removed in certain cases.
		This will require some modification of your code but it
		will certainly be easier to read and more Java-standard.
	We also cleaned out some unused variables, no big deal there.

16	P R E ... R E L ... M O U S E
	Removed GPFuncInfo, a vestigial class which never had any actual
		function (I think!).  This will effect tree builder
		functions and tree breeder functions, but it's easy to
		update: instead of using function sets consisting of
		arrays of GPFuncInfo objects, you have function sets
		consisting of arrays of GPNodes.  And you delete ".node"
		from various places.
	Added newIndividual(...) methods to GPSpecies which override the
		standard ones and perform light cloning rather than
		deep cloning.  A bug fix tickled by our change from
		protoClone to clone.  Thanks to Michael Solano
		(mike.solano@gmail.com).
	Restored docs/tutorial4/GPGraph.png, which had been removed in
		the 14->15 transition by accident
	Moved P_FITNESS into Fitness.java, deleting from other classes,
		and made it consistently equal to "fitness".
	Moved FITNESS_PREAMBLE into Fitness.java, deleting from other
		classes, and made it consistently equal to "Fitness: "
	Moved EVALUATED_PREAMBLE into Individual.java, deleting from
		other classes, and made it consistently equal to
		"Evaluated: "
	Moved P_INDIVIDUAL into Individual.java, deleting from other
		classes, and made it consistently equal to "individual"
	Moved P_DATA into GPProblem.java, deleting from other classes,
		and made it consistently equal to "data"
	Moved CHECKBOUNDARY into BreedingSource, deleting from other
		classes, and made it consistently equal to 8.
	Renamed type -> t in one method in GPSetType
	Renamed data -> dataPart and address -> addressPart in
		MultiplexerSlow and its various functions
	Renamed numRules -> ruleCount in one function in RuleSet
	Changed P_PROB to P_CROSSOVERPROB in RuleCrossoverPipeline.
		Also changed its value from "prob" to "crossover-prob".
		It was incorrectly shadowing P_PROB ( = "prob" ) used
		for a different function in BreedingSource
	Moved the teambots package to the CVS repository contrib
		directory
	Fixed a bug in the Makefile which was building code that depended
		on JFreeChart in the main build.  To fix this, we deleted
		the 'make chart' option and instead created a 'make gui'
		option.  Now the GUI isn't built when you just do 'make'.
		You have to type 'make gui' *and* have the JFreeChart
		etc. jar files installed.
	Small bug fix in FloatVectorSpecies: it wasn't looking for the
		existence of P_MINGENE in the default base and thus was
		complaining even if the default parameter was there.
		Thanks to Elena Popovici (epopvic@cs.gmu.edu).
	A few additions to various Individuals in order to support
		particle swarm optimization
	Added asynchronous distributed evaluation
	Removed final declarations in ParameterDatabase and DecodeReturn.
		Thanks to Remi Vankeisbelck (remi.vankeisbelck@cstb.fr)
	Modifications to the C printing facility in GP.
	Added KozaBuilder as an abstract superclass to GrowBuilder,
		HalfBuilder, and FullBuilder, to simplify redundant
		code and to make it easier to verify consistency of
		the type checks added (see next entry).
	Added more generous type checking to GrowBuilder, HalfBuilder,
		FullBuilder, PTC1, PTC2, and RandomBranch.  Now if
		a terminal or nonterminal is not avaialble when
		an algorithm requests one, rather than failing, in
		most circumstances the algorithm will try for
		a nonterminal or terminal respectively, but will issue
		a warning.  This should help people stuck with typing
		problems but required a lot of retooling and may have
		introduced bugs into the builders.
	Added warning mechanisms in GPNodeBuilder to simplify the type
		checking in the entry above.
	Bug fix in Species.newIndividual and GPSpecies.newIndividual,
		which were calling readGenotype instead of
		readIndividual, resulting in the Fitness not being
		read in right.
	Documentation cleanups in Individual, RuleIndividual, GPIndividual,
		 and Species.
	NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE.  Initializer.initialPopulation now has a 
		thread parameter.
	NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE.  Population.populate and 
		Subpopulation.populate now have thread parameters
	NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE.  The fitness prototype (f_prototype) has 
		been moved from Subpopulation to Species.  This requires any
		previous references to f_prototype to now say
		species.f_prototype
	NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE.  The various newIndividual methods have
		been simplified considerably and made easier to use.  The
		old methods have been made private and final to prevent
		accidental overriding (which would be a bug).  The basic
		newIndividual from scratch now has a thread parameter and
		so can be used in a multithreaded environment.
	Moved in new FloatVectorSpecies and IntegerVectorSpecies, which now
		allow gene min/max to be specified not only globally, and
		by individual gene, but also by gene region.  The new setup
		methods are more complex mostly because they do lots of
		careful checking.  Thanks to Rafal Kicinger.
	javac has grown up and jikes has fallen into disrepair.  We move
		ECJ's default compiler to javac -target 1.3 -source 1.3
	NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE.  GPNode's clone() method will be a deep
		clone call, like everything else.  We've changed all the
		calls to clone() to instead call lightClone() (we hope!)
		and have added an error message to clone() for the time
		being to warn people to use either lightClone() or
		cloneReplacing() instead.  Later on we'll set clone()
		to just call cloneReplacing().
	Added methods for reading and writing populations and subpopulations
		to streams and logs.
	Modifications to SPEA2Subpopulation to read and write the archive size
		when writing subpopulations
	Added T_INTEGER and T_CHARACTER to Code
	Added several methods to Code to simplify reading from files.  Modified
		much existing code to use the Code methods instead of 
		rolling their own.  One unfortunate affect of this is that Code
		now longer is independent of EvolutionState.  Perhaps we might
		make a utility class instead.
	Moved ec/multiobjective/spea/package.html to a README file
	Subpopulations now initialize via loading from files using the new
		file loading code.
	Updates to MersenneTwister and MersenneTwisterFast
	Small setup() fix to VectorSpecies -- wasn't looking up default 
		parameter for crossover type.  Thanks to Michael Orlov
		<orlovm@cs.bgu.ac.il>
	Added indent to make dist
	Added setGenomeLength(...) to VectorIndividuals
	Incorrect parameter (P_PROB instead of P_PROBABILITY) fixed in
		ProportionalTournamentSelection.  Thanks to Robert Baruch
		<autophile@zoominternet.net>

17 Let's get ready to PRERELEASE!
	Deleted some /tmp/out writing crud in ecsuite
	Bug Fix: reading/writing Subpopulations potentially tried to ask
		null individuals to read themselves, and forgot to write out
		a preamble.  Thanks to Tibi Simu <Tiberiu.Simu@ucd.ie>
	Small crossover type parameter bug fixed, and printout error in
		FloatVectorSpecies fixed.  Thanks to Elena Popovici
		<epopovici@gmu.edu>
	tutorial2 and tutorial3 missing fitness parameter declarations.
		Thanks to Rick van Krevelen <krevelen@cs.vu.nl>
	documentation fix (a </ul>) to Prototype which should keep the
		class documentation of all prototypes from getting incorrectly
		indented.
	Added Elena Popovici to the author's list
	Tweaked the post-tutorial discussion
	Updated Mersenne Twister to include SerialVersionUIDs to quiet
		compiler warnings in JDK 1.6
