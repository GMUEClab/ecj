This directory contains some scripts to make it easier to launch MASON if you 
prefer not to have to set your CLASSPATH and run MASON from the command line 
as per the tutorial documentation.

If you wish to use charting but don't know how to set up your CLASSPATH, just
download JFreeChart, JCommon, and iText (see the ECJ website) and place the
jfreechart...jar, jcommon...jar, and itext...jar files directly in the ecj
directory.  The scripts below will find them.  ("..." means "plus some numbers
and letters and a dot" :-)
