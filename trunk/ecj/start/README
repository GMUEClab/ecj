This directory contains some scripts to make it easier to launch ECJ's GUI.  Be
warned that the GUI is fairly rudimentary: in truth we almost exclusively use
the command line.  So the GUI isn't particularly well supported.

If you wish to use charting but don't know how to set up your CLASSPATH, just
download JFreeChart, JCommon, and iText (see the ECJ website) and place the
jfreechart...jar, jcommon...jar, and itext...jar files directly in the ecj
directory.  The scripts below will find them.  ("..." means "plus some numbers
and letters and a dot" :-)

ecj.command
	Double-click on this file, or alternatively launch it from the command line,
	to run the ECJ GUI. If you have other jar files you'd like to add, just dump
	them into the 'mason' directory.  This script uses .tcsh.  Runs Java 1.4.x

ecj.bat
	This DOS batch file will launch ECJ, provided that you double click on it 
	or an a shortcut to it. It adds the jars files in the 'ecj' directory to the 
	class path. 
	
ignoreme.bat
	Auxiliary batch file used by ecj.bat to add items to the classpath.  Pay
	it no attention.
