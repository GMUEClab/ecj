This directory contains two examples for the ECJ master/slave evaluator.
See ec/eval/README for more information on how to run the evaluator
and the ec/eval/master.params file for more parameter information and
options.

NOTE: these examples are worst-case scenarios for the master/slave
evaluator -- they evaluate rapidly and so the time is CONSUMED by
transfering over the net.  The examples are only here to give you 
the idea of how to get your own jobs up and running.


Artificial Ant (change the eval.master.host in ant.slave.params to the
	appropriate IP of the master's machine.  By default it's
	127.0.0.1, which only works if all the slaves are on the
	same machine as the host; this configuration is likely 
	only useful for testing purposes)

MASTER:		java ec.Evolve -file ant.master.params
EACH SLAVE:	java ec.eval.Slave -file ant.slave.params



Coevolve1 - an example of competitive coevolution using the
	master-slave architecture. (change the eval.master.host 
	in coevolve1.slave.params to the
        appropriate IP of the master's machine.  By default it's
        127.0.0.1, which only works if all the slaves are on the
        same machine as the host; this configuration is likely 
        only useful for testing purposes). 

MASTER:         java ec.Evolve -file coevolve1.master.params
EACH SLAVE:     java ec.eval.Slave -file coevolve1.slave.params


Coevolve2 - an example of cooperative coevolution using the
	master-slave architecture. (change the eval.master.host 
	in coevolve2.slave.params to the
        appropriate IP of the master's machine.  By default it's
        127.0.0.1, which only works if all the slaves are on the
        same machine as the host; this configuration is likely
        only useful for testing purposes).

MASTER:         java ec.Evolve -file coevolve2.master.params
EACH SLAVE:     java ec.eval.Slave -file coevolve2.slave.params
