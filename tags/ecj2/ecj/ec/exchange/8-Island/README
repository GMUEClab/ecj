In this model, eight islands are created:
Ellis, Gilligans, Coney, Fantasy, Rhode, Survivor, Temptation,
and Treasure Island.  Survivor Island will be the server.

To run this example, launch eight processes, each with
the appropriate .params file for that island.  

In client.params, you'll need to modify the parameter

	exch.server-addr = your.server.address.here.com 

To the address of your server, whatever it is.  Alternatively
you can just override this parameter with the -p option when
you run your processes.

If you'd like to run two or more processes on the same
machine, you'll need to tweak the parameter files so that
each has a different client port.  The parameter to modify
is:
	exch.client-port = 9030

...otherwise you will get a null pointer exception.

For a simpler example, see the README file in 3-Island.
