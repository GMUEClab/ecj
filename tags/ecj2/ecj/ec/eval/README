This directory contains the code for running the ECJ master/slave
evaluator.  The master/slave evaluator allows you to connect one ECJ
evolution process with some N remove slave processes.  These processes
can come on-line at any time, and you can add new processes at any
time, perhaps if new machines come available, or to replace slaves
which have died for some reason.

Slaves' random number generators are based on the wall clock time
(they're each given a different seed by the master), regardless of
their seeds in their parameter files.

You can use the master/slave evaluator in conjunction with island 
models to connect each island to its own private group of N slaves,
though we have no examples for that in the distribution.

Read the master.params file for information about the various parameter
options.  

Typical params files for the master and for the slaves are illustrated in
the ec/app/star directory.


You fire up the master something like this:

java ec.Evolve -file foo.master.params


You fire up each of the N slaves something like this:

java ec.eval.Slave -file foo.slave.params

...and it should all nicely work!  The system works fine under 
checkpointing as far as we know.
