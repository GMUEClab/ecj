                 program size and no detrimental effect on GP
                 performance. GP search spaces are partitioned by the
                 ridge in the number of program versus their size and

  Abstract =	 {At RoboCup, teams of autonomous robots or software
                  softbots compete in simulated soccer matches to
                  demonstrate cooperative robotics techniques in a
                  very difficult, real-time, noisy environment. At the
                  IJCAI/RoboCup97 softbot competition, all entries but
                  ours used human-crafted cooperative decision-making
                  behaviors. We instead entered a softbot team whose
                  high-level decision making behaviors had been
                  entirely evolved using genetic programming. Our team
                  won its first two games against human-crafted
                  opponent teams, and received the RoboCup Scientific
                  Challenge Award. This report discusses the issues we
                  faced and the approach we took to use GP to evolve
                  our robot soccer team for this difficult
                  environment.},
