In this model, three islands are created:
Wallops, Assateague, and Chincoteague.
Wallops will be the server.

To run this example, launch three processes
using the wallops.params, assateague.params, or 
chincoteague.params parameter files respectively.
If you're running them on the same machines, you can
simply do:

java ec.Evolve -file wallops.params

java ec.Evolve -file assateague.params

java ec.Evolve -file chincoteague.params

If you're running the processes on different machines,  
you'll need to modify the server address
so the machines know where wallops (the server) is located:

java ec.Evolve -file wallops.params 

java ec.Evolve -file assateague.params \
    -p exch.server-addr=address.of.wallops.com

java ec.Evolve -file chincoteague.params \
    -p exch.server-addr=address.of.wallops.com

The parameter files have been set up to define different
socket ports for each client; though this is only necessary
if they're running on the same computer.
