/**
 * Prototype classes typically have one or a few <i>prototype instances</i>
 * created during the course of a run.  These prototype instances each get
 * setup(...) called on them.  From then on, all new instances of a Prototype
 * classes are Cloned from these prototype instances.
 *
 * <p>The purpose of a prototype is to make it possible to ask classes,
 * determined at run-time by user parameters, to instantiate
 * themselves very many times without using the Reflection library, which 
 * would be very inefficient.
 *
 * <p>ECJ makes extensive use of Prototypes.  Individuals are prototypes.
 * Species are prototypes.  Fitness objects are prototypes.  Breeding
 * pipelines and selection methods are prototypes.  In the GP section, 
 * GPNodes and GPTrees are prototypes.  In the Rule section, Rulesets and
 * Rules are prototypes.  In the Vector section, Genes are prototypes.
 * And so on.
 *
 * <p>ECJ uses Prototypes almost exclusively instead of calling <tt>new</tt>.
 * This is because <tt>new</t> requires that you know, in your code, the exact
 * class of the object to be created.  Doing so programmatically essentially
 * precludes being able to set up object graphs dynamically from parameter files.
 * 
 * <p>Sadly, clone() is rather slower than calling <tt>new</tt>.  However
 * it <i>is</i> a lot faster than calling java.lang.Class.newInstance(),
 * and somewhat faster than rolling our own "cloner" method.
 *
 * <p>Prototypes must be Cloneable, Serializable (through Setup), and of
 * course, Setup.

        <p>Typically this should be a full "deep" clone.
        However, you may share certain elements with other objects
        rather than clone hem, depending on the situation:

        <p>
        <ul>
        <li>If you hold objects which are shared with other instances,
        don't clone them.
        <li>If you hold objects which must be unique, clone them.
        <li>If you hold objects which were given to you as a gesture
        of kindness, and aren't owned by you, you probably shouldn't clone
        them.
        <li> DON'T attempt to clone: Singletons, Cliques, or Groups.
        <li>Arrays are not cloned automatically; you may need to
        clone an array if you're not sharing it with other instances.
        Arrays have the nice feature of being copyable by calling clone()
        on them.
        </ul>

        <p><b>Implementations.</b>

        <ul>
        <li>If no ancestor of yours implements clone(),
        and you have no need to do clone deeply,
        and you are abstract, then you should not declare clone().
        
        <li>If no ancestor of yours implements clone(),
        and you have no need to do clone deeply,
        and you are <b>not</b> abstract, then you should implement
        it as follows:

        <p>
        <tt><pre>
        * public Object clone() 
        *     {
        *     try
        *         { 
        *         return super.clone();
        *         }
        *     catch ((CloneNotSupportedException e)
        *         { throw new InternalError(); } // never happens
        *     }
        </pre></tt>
        
        <li>If no ancestor of yours implements clone(), but you
        need to deep-clone some things, then you should implement it
        as follows:

        <p>
        <tt><pre>
        * public Object clone() 
        *     {
        *     try
        *         { 
        *         MyObject myobj = (MyObject) (super.clone());
        *
        *         // put your deep-cloning code here...
        *         }
        *     catch ((CloneNotSupportedException e)
        *         { throw new InternalError(); } // never happens
        *     return myobj;
        *     } 
        </pre></tt>

        <li>If an ancestor has implemented clone(), and you also need
        to deep clone some things, then you should implement it as follows:

        <p>
        <tt><pre>
        * public Object clone() 
        *     { 
        *     MyObject myobj = (MyObject) (super.clone());
        *
        *     // put your deep-cloning code here...
        *
        *     return myobj;
        *     }
