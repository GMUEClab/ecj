/**
 * Problem is a prototype which defines the problem against which we will
 * evaluate individuals in a population. 
 *
 * <p>Since Problems are Prototypes, you should expect a new Problem class to be
 * cloned and used, on a per-thread basis, for the evolution of each
 * chunk of individuals in a new population.  If you for some reason
 * need global Problem information, you will have to provide it
 * statically, or copy pointers over during the clone() process
 * (there is likely only one Problem prototype, depending on the
 * Evaluator class used).
 *
 * <p>Note that Problem does not implement a specific evaluation method.
 * Your particular Problem subclass will need to implement a some kind of
 * Problem Form (for example, SimpleProblemForm) appropriate to the kind of
 * evaluation being performed on the Problem.  These Problem Forms will provide
 * the evaluation methods necessary.
 *
 * <p>Problem forms will define some kind of <i>evaluation</i> method.  This method
 * may be called in one of two ways by the Evaluator.
 *
 * <ul> 
 * <li> The evaluation is called for a series of individuals.  This is the old approach,
 * and it means that each individual must be evaluated and modified as specified by the
 * Problem Form during the evaluation call.
 * <li> prepareToEvaluate is called, then a series of individuals is evaluated, and then
 * finishEvaluating is called.  This is the new approach, and in this case the Problem
 * is free to delay evaluating and modifying the individuals until finishEvaluating has
 * been called.  The Problem may perfectly well evaluate and modify the individuals during
 * each evaluation call if it likes.  It's just given this additional option.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Problems should be prepared for both of the above situations.  The easiest way
 * to handle it is to simply evaluate each individual as his evaluate(...) method is called,
 * and do nothing during prepareToEvaluate or finishEvaluating.  That should be true for
 * the vast majority of Problem types.
