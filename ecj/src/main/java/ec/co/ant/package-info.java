/**
 * Ant Colony Optimization algorithms
 *
 * This package contains the components necessary to implement ACO algorithms, specifically the classic pair: Ant System
 * and Ant Colony System.
 *
 * The central object in this package is <code>AntSpecies</code>, which coordinates most of the other components.
 *
 * Have a look at the the <code>ec.app.tsp</code> and <code>ec.app.knapsack</code> example apps to get a sense of how
 * these components can be used in practice.
