This is ECJ's DOvS package.  To see this package in action, try the application
examples ec/app/highdimension and ec/app/singular

WARNING: DOvS doesn't work quite right yet.  We're including it as a preview
but you should not rely on it (you'll notice that highdimension has strange
fitness results for example).

DOvS has a custom breeder, evaluator, and initializer, though this may change
in the future.  DOvS individuals are presently IntegerVectorIndividual, but
this may be broadened later.  DOvS has an abstract species called DOVSSpecies
and one concrete subclass called HyperboxSpecies (for the moment).
