This is ECJ's AMaLGaM IDEA package (or more properly, iAMaLGaM IDEA).  
To see this package in action, try running ECJ on the file "ec/app/ecsuite/amalgam.params"

Much like CMA-ES, ECJ's AMaLGaM IDEA implementation has a custom breeder and 
no breeding pipelines.  However you will find that nearly all the work takes 
place inside AMALGAMSpecies.java, and the breeder is little more than a wrapper
to call methods there.  We have:

AMALGAMDefaults.java		Package Defaults
AMALGAMSpecies.java		AMaLGaM IDEA's species object.  This uses
				DoubleVectorIndividuals for its representation.
AMALGAMBreeder.java		Custom breeder for AMaLGaM IDEA, which 
				largely calls code in AMALGAMSpecies
