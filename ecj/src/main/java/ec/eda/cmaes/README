This is ECJ's CMA-ES package.  To see this package in action, try running ECJ
on the file "ec/app/ecsuite/cmaes.params"

CMA-ES has a custom breeder and initialzier and no breeding pipelines.  However
you will find that nearly all the work for CMA-ES takes place inside 
CMAESSpecies.java, and the breeder and initializer are little more than wrappers
to call methods there.  So we have:

CMAESDefaults.java		Package Defaults
CMAESSpecies.java		CMAES's species object.  CMAES uses
				DoubleVectorIndividuals for its representation.
CMAESBreeder.java		Custom breeder for CMAES, largely calls
				code in CMAESSpecies
CMAESInitializer.java		Custom initializer for CMAES, largely calls
				code in CMAESSpecies
