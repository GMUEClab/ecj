Mona is an implementation of the Mona Lisa problem originally proposed
and then later built upon by Roger Alsing 

http://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/

Alsing's approach is fairly funky: and his claim that it's genetic programming
is mistaken.  This code is an attempt to put the method on a bit firmer footing,
though it still needs some tweaking to get back to Alsing's original performance.
I encourage you to play with it.
