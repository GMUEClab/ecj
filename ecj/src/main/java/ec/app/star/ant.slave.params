# You may want to customize each slave by giving it a unique
# name like this:
# 
# eval.slave.name = my-slave-name
#
# (do this differently for each slave:, slave-2, slave-3, etc.)
# Otherwise, each slave will give itself an approximately unique name based
# on the current time and the IP address of the slave.  The unique name
# doesn't HAVE to be unique -- it's just for printing/debug purposes.


# We want to make sure that the Slave's Statistics object does not
# override the Master's statistics files.  The easiest way to do this
# is to eliminate the Statistics object in the slave by setting it
# to the (empty default) Statistics class with no children.

# The slave needs to know where the Master is.  You need to
