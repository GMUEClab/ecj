# Be sure to set the multiobjective fitness size as shown in ../multiobjective.params
# Likewise note that ../multiobjective.params sets the statistics

# the size of the elitist archive.  This must not be larger
# than the subpopulation size, and it generally could be roughly
# the size of the number of solutions you expect.  If your subpopulation
# was 1024 in size, maybe this might be a reasonable value...

### IMPORTANT NOTE: SPEA2 assumes that you're using tournament selection.
# You could use another selection operator if you so chose, but it wouldn't
# be the same as the standard SPEA2 algorithm
