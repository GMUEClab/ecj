        Why would you want to shut down?
        This would happen for two reasons.  First, another process might have found
        an ideal individual and the global run is now over.  Second, some network
        or operating system error may have occurred and the system needs to be shut
        down gracefully.  Note that if the exchanger wants to shut down, the system
        will shut down REGARDLESS of whether or not the user stated 
        ec.EvolutionState.quitOnRunComplete. */
