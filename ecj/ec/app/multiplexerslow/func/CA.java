/**
   CA.java
        
   Implements a 1-dimensional toroidal CA for purposes of doing the binary majority classification problem.
   You need to supply the automaton size and the rule neighborhood size at constructor time.
   The CA itself consists of an array of integers, each 0 or 1.   You can clear this array, set it to
   preset values, or randomize it.
   You provide the rule as an array of ints, all 0 or 1 as well.  The rules are specified in the following
   order.  Let's say that you have a neighborhood of 3, consiting of cells LCR, where L is the cell "left"
   of the target cell (left is less than, right is greater than).  Then the order of the rules are for the
   neighborhoods 0: 000, 1: 001, 2: 010, 3: 011, 4: 100, 5: 101, 6: 110, 7: 111.   In other words, the
   neighborhood is interpreted as a binary number and that's the index into the rule.
