# Differential Evolution requires a special statistics object 
# (ec.de.DEStatistics) to deal with certain issues that arise in parent/child 
# competition.  See the DEStatistics documentation for more discussion.  The 
# way we use the object is as the primary statistics object, and then we hang
# SimpleStatistics as a subsidiary statistics object off of it like so:
stat = 					ec.de.DEStatistics
stat.num-children = 			1
stat.child.0 = 				ec.simple.SimpleStatistics
stat.child.0.file = 			$out.stat
