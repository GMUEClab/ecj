In this model, three islands are created:
Wallops, Assateague, and Chincoteague.
Wallops will be the server.

To run this example, launch three processes
on three different machines, one each including the
wallops.params, assateague.params, or chincoteague.params
parameter files.  

In client.params, you'll need to modify the parameter

	exch.server-addr = your.server.address.here.com 

To the address of your server, whatever it is.  Alternatively
you can just override this parameter with the -p option when
you run your processes.

If you'd like to run two or more processes on the same
machine, you'll need to tweak the parameter files so that
each has a different client port.  The parameter to modify
is:

	exch.client-port = 9030

...otherwise you will get a null pointer exception.

Here's a simple example.  In three separate terminal
windows, launch the following three processes:

java ec.Evolve -file wallops.params -p \
    exch.server-addr=localhost -p exch.client-port=9032

java ec.Evolve -file assateague.params \
    -p exch.server-addr=localhost -p exch.client-port=9033

java ec.Evolve -file chincoteague.params \
    -p exch.server-addr=localhost -p exch.client-port=9034
