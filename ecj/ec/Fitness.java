/**
 * Fitness is a prototype which describes the fitness of an individual.
 * Every individual contains exactly one Fitness object.
 * Fitness objects are compared to each other with the equivalentTo()
 * and betterThan(), etc. methods. 
 *
 <p>Rules: 
 <table>
 <tr><td><b>comparison</b></td><td><b>method</b></td></tr>
 <tr><td>a &gt; b</td><td>a.betterThan(b)</td>
 <tr><td>a &gt;= b</td><td>a.betterThan(b) || a.equivalentTo(b)</td>
 <tr><td>a = b</td><td>a.equivalentTo(b)</td>
 </table>

 This applies even to multiobjective pareto-style dominance, eg:
 <ul>
 <li> a dominates b :: a &gt; b
 <li> a and b do not dominate each other :: a = b
 <li> b dominates a :: a &lt; b
 </ul>

 <p><b>Parameter bases</b><br>

        <p>Selection methods relying on fitness proportionate information will
        <b>assume the fitness is non-negative</b> and should throw an error

        procedures, etc.) your fitness values can be anything.
        
        <p>Similarly, if you're writing a selection method and it needs positive
        fitnesses, you should check for negative values and issue an error; and
        if your selection method doesn't need an <i>absolute</i> fitness
        value, it should use the equivalentTo() and betterThan() methods instead.
        
        <p> If your fitness scheme does not use a metric quantifiable to
        a single positive value (for example, MultiObjectiveFitness), you should 
        perform some reasonable translation.
