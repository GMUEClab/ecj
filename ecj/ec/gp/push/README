This directory contains an experimental version of the PUSH/PUSHGP
facility running on top of a java-based PUSH interpreter called
"Psh".  To use it you will need to install the psh.jar file which
comes with ECJ's library jar files (see the ECJ website).  Do not
use the version on the Psh website, as it has the wrong kind of
random number generator.  

The makefile does not by default build this directory, but you can 
do so by saying    make push

The code works by creating a GPIndividual consisting solely of
two kinds of nodes: dummy nonterminal nodes (ec.gp.push.Nonterminal)
and leaf nodes holding Push instructions (ec.gp.push.Terminal).  
The nonterminals
do nothing at all, all that matters are the leaf nodes.  A leaf
node is a GP ERC which contains a single randomly-chosen Push
instruction.  Push instructions can be one of three possible types:

	- Built-in Push instructions understood by the Psh
	  interpreter.  Examples include float.* or integer.+
	  A full list of valid Psh instructions is at the end
	  of this file.

	- Push ERCs.  Psh supports two ERC types: floats and
	  integers.  For ERCs you will supply a minimum and
	  maximum value.

	- Custom instructions of your own devising.  These
	  are subclasses of ec.gp.push.PushInstruction.

You test an individual by creating a subclass of PushProblem
which creates or resets a Push Interpreter, then seeds the
interpreter's stacks with data as necessary, then executes
the GP Individual on the interpreter, then reads the stacks
and compares against expected results.  

A GP Individual is not directly executed on the Push Interpreter.
Instead at present it is written out to a string which is then
parsed into the interpreter.

Note that the psh.jar file provided with ECJ contains modified 
versions of the Interpreter.java and Instructions.java files
which do two things:
	A. Replace java.util.Random with MersenneTwisterFast
	B. Fix errors in usage of random number generators


WEAKNESSES

This is just an experimental approach, though it does work fine.

1. Slow.  Psh isn't super fast.

2. There's no code (yet) for taking push programs and rebuilding
   the GP tree to reflect the program after evaluation.  This is
   a common Push task, so it'd be nice to do it at some point.

3. At present push ERC instructions must be hard-coded in the
   Terminal.java file.  Right now we have float.erc and integer.erc
   If necessary we could break out ERCs into custom classes though
   I suspect there wouldn't be much return on investment there.

4. You'll have to be careful with the tree modification operators
   you choose because some of them assume that the arity is fixed.
   But GP crossover should work as well as tree mutation if you use
   the provided PushBuilder tree builder.

5. Current Push work is being done on a Clojure-based interpreter.
   We're using Psh here because it was the fastest way to get up
   and running but eventually we may move to the Clojure version.
