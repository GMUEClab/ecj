/**
 * Species is a prototype which defines the features for a set of individuals
 * in the population.  Typically, individuals may breed if they belong to the
 * same species (but it's not a hard-and-fast rule).  Each Subpopulation has
 * one Species object which defines the species for individuals in that
 * Subpopulation.
 *
 * <p>Species are generally responsible for creating individuals, through
 * their newIndividual(...) method.  This method usually clones its prototypical
 * individual and makes some additional modifications to the clone, then returns it.
 * Note that the prototypical individual does <b>not need to be a complete individual</b> --
 * for example, GPSpecies holds a GPIndividual which doesn't have any trees (the tree
 * roots are null).
 *
 * <p>Species also holds a prototypical breeding pipeline meant to breed
 * this individual.  To breed individuals of this species, clone the pipeline
 * and use the clone.
