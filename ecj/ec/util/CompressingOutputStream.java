/**
 * CompressingInputStream and DecompressingOutputStream allow you to
 * perform compression on a stream, and flush it, and continue to use it.
 * This is useful if you're planning on compressing a stream socket.
 * Ordinarily compression does not send partial blocks across the stream
 * for efficiency's sake.  That's not good because we want to use a stream
 * socket and the other side will just block waiting for a big chunk of data
 * that may take a long time to show up.  This simulates the Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH
 * and Z_SYNC_FLUSH mechanisms in zlib.  The code was largely stolen from 
 * the comments at
 * <p>
 * http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4255743.html <br>
 * http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4206909.html <br>
 *
 * <p>Beware that, like other compression streams, you should NOT construct
 * multiple CompressingOutputStreams and attach them one by one to the same
 * underlying OutputStream, throwing each away one by one.  This won't work.
 * Instread, construct one CompressingOutputStream wrapped around your
 * underlying OutputStream and just use that.
