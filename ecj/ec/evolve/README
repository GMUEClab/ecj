This package contains utility operations which can be plugged into most
evolutionary loops, but are neither evaluation, breeding, nor exchange
procedures.

At present there is exactly one class here:


ec.evolve.RandomRestarts	[UNTESTED]

This class is a Statistics subclass and is attached into the Statistics chain.
The class resets the evolutionary procedure every once in a while, by
calling Population.populate(...) (with an empty loadInds file), which causes
the Population to create all new indivdiuals.
