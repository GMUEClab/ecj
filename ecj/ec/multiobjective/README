This directory contains tools for multiobjective optimization.  The top-level
package, ec.multiobjective, just contains a basic multiobjective fitness class
which has multiple fitness values and a flag indicating whether higher
fitness is "better". (By default, ECJ assumes higher values are better, but
it is particularly common in multiobjective optimization that lower is better,
so we've added this rather than tilt at windmills).

Actual implementations for multiobjective optimization are in subdirectories.
At present, ECJ only contains code for the SPEA2 algorithm.
