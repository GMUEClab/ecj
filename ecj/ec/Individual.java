/**
 * An Individual is an item in the EC population stew which is evaluated 
 * and assigned a fitness which determines its likelihood of selection.
 * Individuals are created most commonly by the newIndividual(...) method
 * of the ec.Species class.
 *
 * <P>In general Individuals are immutable.  That is, once they are created
 * they should not be modified.  This protocol helps insure that they are
 * safe to read under multithreaded conditions.  You can violate this protocol,
 * but try to do so when you know you have only have a single thread.
 *
 * <p>In addition to serialization for checkpointing, Individuals may read and write themselves to streams in three ways.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>writeIndividual(...,DataOutput)/readIndividual(...,DataInput)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This method
 * transmits or receives an individual in binary.  It is the most efficient approach to sending
 * individuals over networks, etc.  These methods write the evaluated flag and the fitness, then
 * call <b>readGenotype/writeGenotype</b>, which you must implement to write those parts of your 
 * Individual special to your functions-- the default versions of readGenotype/writeGenotype throw errors.
 * You don't need to implement them if you don't plan on using read/writeIndividual.
 *
 * <li><b>printIndividual(...,PrintWriter)/readIndividual(...,LineNumberReader)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
 * approacch transmits or receives an indivdual in text encoded such that the individual is largely readable
 * by humans but can be read back in 100% by ECJ as well.  To do this, these methods will encode numbers
 * using the <tt>ec.util.Code</tt> class.  These methods are mostly used to write out populations to
 * files for inspection, slight modification, then reading back in later on.  <b>readIndividual</b>reads
 * in the fitness and the evaluation flag, then calls <b>parseGenotype</b> to read in the remaining individual.
 * You are responsible for implementing parseGenotype: the Code class is there to help you.
 * <b>printIndividual</b> writes out the fitness and evaluation flag, then calls <b>genotypeToString<b> 
 * and printlns the resultant string. You are responsible for implementing the genotypeToString method in such
 * a way that parseGenotype can read back in the individual println'd with genotypeToString.  The default form
 * of genotypeToString simply calls <b>toString</b>, which you may override instead if you like.  The default
 * form of <b>parseGenotype</b> throws an error.  You are not required to implement these methods, but without
 * them you will not be able to write individuals to files in a simultaneously computer- and human-readable fashion.
 *
 * <li><b>printIndividualForHumans(...,PrintWriter)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
 * approacch prints an individual in a fashion intended for human consumption only.
 * <b>printIndividualForHumans</b> writes out the fitness and evaluation flag, then calls <b>genotypeToStringForHumans<b> 
 * and printlns the resultant string. You are responsible for implementing the genotypeToStringForHumans method.
 * The default form of genotypeToStringForHumans simply calls <b>toString</b>, which you may override instead if you like
 * (though note that genotypeToString's default also calls toString).  You should handle one of these methods properly
 * to ensure individuals can be printed by ECJ.
 * </ul>
