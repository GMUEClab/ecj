/**
 * A BreedingSource is a Prototype which 
 * provides Individuals to populate new populations based on
 * old ones.  The BreedingSource/BreedingPipeline/SelectionMethod mechanism
 * is inherently designed to work within single subpopulations, which is
 * by far the most common case.  If for some
 * reason you need to breed among different subpopulations to produce new ones
 * in a manner that can't be handled with exchanges, you will probably have to
 * write your own custom Breeder; you'd have to write your own custom breeding
 * pipelines anyway of course, though you can probably get away with reusing
 * the SelectionMethods.
 *
 * <p>A BreedingSource may have parent sources which feed it as well.
 * Some BreedingSources, <i>SelectionMethods</i>,
 * are meant solely to plug into other BreedingSources, <i>BreedingPipelines</i>.
 * BreedingPipelines can plug into other BreedingPipelines, and can also be
 * used to provide the final Individual meant to populate a new generation.
 *
 * <p>Think of BreedingSources as Streams of Individuals; at one end of the
 * stream is the provider, a SelectionMethod, which picks individuals from
 * the old population.  At the other end of the stream is a BreedingPipeline
 * which hands you the finished product, a small set of new Individuals
 * for you to use in populating your new population.
