Makefile		Useful if you're running under UNIX

ECJ has two modules which rely on external libraies
which you can download as JAR files from the ECJ website
(here:  http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/libraries.zip ).
None of the libraries are required, but if you don't install
them you need to tweak ECJ a bit in order to get it to compile:

- The GUI system relies in part on the JFreeChart and iText
  libraries.  If you do not install these, you cannot compile
  the GUI at all.  You can completely delete the GUI code if
  you like (it's entirely contained within ec/display/ ) or
  if you're using Makefile, just do "make" rather than
  "make gui".

- The distributed evaluation and island model code relies on
  compressed socket options for more efficiency, and Java's
  standard libraries are broken, so they require the JZlib
  library.  If you do not install JZlib library, the code
  will still compile but you will need to turn compression
  *off* in order to run distributed evaluation or island
  models.

TO COMPILE: under UNIX, just type:

  make gui       (if you have JFreeChart and iText installed)

or

  make           (otherwise)

You can build a JAR file out of ECJ, if you like, with

  make jar

WHERE TO ASK QUESTIONS: if you're really stuck, try the
ECJ-INTEREST mailing list.  (see "Mailing Lists" at
