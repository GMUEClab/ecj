Makefile		Useful if you're running under UNIX


ECJ has one optional module which relies on external 
facilities.  If you choose not to use it, you need to 
delete its directory or otherwise turn off using it in
the Makefile:

- The GUI system relies in part on the JFreeChart and iText
  facilities from jfreechart.org (add the jfreechart*.jar and
  jcommon*.jar files to your CLASSPATH) and from
  http://www.lowagie.com/iText/ (add the itext*.jar file to
  your CLASSPATH).  The system does not require them but you
  will not be able to compile the charting facility without
  them.
